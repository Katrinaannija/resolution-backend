### **Government Announcement – Closure of GOR**

**OFFICIAL STATEMENT / DEPARTMENTAL CIRCULAR**

**From:** The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government 

**Date:** 22 July 2010 

**Subject:** Abolition of the Government Offices for the Regions

**To:** All Departmental Staff and External Partners

The Government has today announced its intention to close the Government Offices for the Regions (GOR). This decision is part of the Government's broader strategy to shift power away from central government to local councils and communities.

While final transition arrangements are being established, it is intended that the network of Government Offices for the Regions will effectively cease operations by the **end of March 2011**.

Consequently, the functions currently undertaken by the GOR network will be reviewed. Decisions regarding the continuation or suspension of specific project requirements and associated spending will be taken in light of this structural change.
