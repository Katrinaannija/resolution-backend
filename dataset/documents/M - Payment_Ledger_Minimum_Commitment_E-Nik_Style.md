# **Payment Ledger – Consultancy Services Contract**

This payment ledger summarises all invoices issued under the hypothetical consultancy services agreement (mirroring the structure of E‑Nik v DCLG). It shows which invoices have been paid in full and which remain outstanding. The unpaid invoices correspond to the minimum‑usage shortfall in Years 1 and 2 and the final six‑month period.
