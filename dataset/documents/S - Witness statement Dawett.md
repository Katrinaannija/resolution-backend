**IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE QUEEN’S BENCH DIVISION COMMERCIAL COURT**

**Claim No: 2012 Folio 745**

**BETWEEN:**

**E-NIK LTD – Claimant and DEPARTMENT FOR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT – Defendant**

**WITNESS STATEMENT OF MS DAWETT**

I, Ms Dawett, of E-Nik Ltd, will say as follows:

**A. Introduction and role**

1. I am a director and 50% shareholder of the Claimant, E-Nik Ltd (“E-Nik”). I have held that position at all material times.  
2. I was personally responsible for negotiating the consultancy contract with the Defendant, the Department for Communities and Local Government (“DCLG”), which is dated 1 April 2009 and is referred to in these proceedings as “the Contract”.  
3. The facts and matters set out in this statement are within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated. Where they are matters of information or belief, I identify the source and believe them to be true.

**B. Prior relationship and commercial background**

4. E-Nik is an information technology consultancy specialising in project management, analysis and systems development for government ICT systems.  
5. By 2008, DCLG (including its Government Offices for the Regions, “GOR”) was purchasing approximately 800 days of consultancy work per year from E-Nik, under various agreements at day rates generally between £750 and £1,200 depending on seniority and the work involved. These rates were at or slightly below the industry norm.  
6. The Contract was negotiated against that background. DCLG wished to secure E-Nik’s continued availability for its ICT projects over a fixed period, rather than placing ad hoc instructions.

**C. Negotiation and conclusion of the Contract**

7. During late 2008 and early 2009 I negotiated the terms of the Contract with Mr David Bentley, who at that time was DCLG’s representative responsible for these consultancy arrangements.  
8. The Contract is dated 1 April 2009\. It is an appendix to an overarching agreement between DCLG and Fujitsu Services Ltd (the “Fujitsu Agreement”), under which Fujitsu initially acted as an intermediary. In practice Fujitsu quickly fell out of the picture and the commercial relationship operated directly between E-Nik and DCLG.  
9. The Contract provided for a fixed term of 2½ years, from 1 April 2009 to 30 September 2011, with a right for either party to terminate on 12 months’ written notice. No such notice was ever given by either party.  
10. On 12 May 2009, I emailed Mr Bentley: “Please could you confirm that the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year for the duration of the contract”.  
11. On 15 May 2009, he replied: “Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik’s engagement for work.”  
12. The Contract was executed shortly afterwards. My husband and fellow shareholder signed on behalf of E-Nik on 20 May 2009, and Mr Bentley signed on behalf of DCLG on 21 May 2009\.

**D. Key contractual terms – minimum days, rates and invoicing**

13. Under the Contract, DCLG undertook to purchase a minimum of 500 days of consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement.  
14. The reference to project requirements reflected how that minimum was originally assessed; it did not permit DCLG unilaterally to reduce the minimum to zero.  
15. The day rate for such consultancy was set at not less than £850 per day. The Contract provided that E-Nik’s fees were to be paid within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice.  
16. The Contract also required E-Nik to provide monthly Excel reports showing, among other things, work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased. This was intended to give DCLG a running picture of how many days remained under the minimum annual commitment.  
17. Appendix 2 to the Fujitsu Agreement set out the process for purchase orders and invoicing. In summary, it contemplated that E-Nik would invoice yearly in advance for the services, corresponding to the minimum days. In practice, as explained below, we invoiced progressively for work done and, towards the end of the Contract, for the unused balance of the minimum days.

**E. Provision and availability of services**

18. From 1 April 2009, E-Nik assembled and maintained a team of consultants to service DCLG’s needs under the Contract.  
19. We planned our staffing on the basis that DCLG would be calling on at least 500 days per year and kept capacity available accordingly throughout the term.  
20. During the first part of the Contract, DCLG regularly called off services, and we provided substantial consultancy work across several projects. Those days were invoiced in the ordinary way and paid without dispute.  
21. In line with clause 3.8, we produced monthly Excel spreadsheets recording for each month: the number of days of consultancy used; the remaining balance of days under the 500-day annual minimum (or pro-rated minimum for the final half-year); and any additional days used in excess of the minimum, where applicable.  
22. I exhibit to this statement a spreadsheet (marked “CD1”) which consolidates those monthly records for the period 1 April 2009 to 30 September 2011\.  
23. At all times during the term we stood ready, willing and able to provide the 500 days of consultancy per year throughout the period of the contract.  
24. Where DCLG chose not to request services in a given period, we nevertheless maintained that availability, holding consultants back from other commitments so that they would be free for DCLG when required.

**F. Announcement of GOR closure and continuing availability**

25. Following the change of Government in 2010, it was announced (in or around July 2010\) that the Government was to close the Government Offices for the Regions. However, we did not think that this would affect us at all because a lot of the projects on which we were working did not only involve that Office.  
26. We therefore continued to keep our consultancy team available for DCLG, on the basis that the Contract remained in force until at least 30 September 2011, and no notice of termination under the 12-month notice provision had been given.  
27. On 17 December 2010, I chaired a meeting between E-Nik and DCLG described in the minutes as a “General review & engagement strategy” meeting. One of the DCLG attendees was Ms Kate Kedge. In that meeting Ms Kedge requested that enik continue providing services until advised otherwise.  
28. That request confirmed to me that DCLG still expected and wished us to remain available under the Contract notwithstanding the announced closure of the GOR.  
29. The GOR were in fact closed at the end of March 2011\. Even after the closure we continued to hold our consultants available for DCLG’s work under the Contract.  
30. On 15 April 2011, I received an email from Mr David Main of DCLG, in which he stated that he was “afraid that we will have to suspend the current work that you are carrying out”, and went on to say that the current suspension “is not an indicator as to what happens next, and does not prejudice and future decision or action”.  
31. I understood this to be a temporary suspension of specific work, not a termination of the Contract or a repudiation of the minimum-days commitment. Neither at that time nor subsequently did DCLG give any notice purporting to terminate the Contract under its express termination provision.  
32. In light of that, and of the December 2010 meeting and April 2011 email, E-Nik continued, throughout the period to 30 September 2011, to hold itself available to provide up to the minimum number of consultancy days per year as required.

**G. Invoicing history and the unpaid invoices**

33. Throughout the Contract E-Nik invoiced DCLG in two ways: initially, for days actually worked, based on time records and the monthly spreadsheets; and subsequently, for the unused balance of the minimum annual (and pro-rated) days which DCLG had undertaken to purchase but had not called off.  
34. For the earlier part of the Contract, invoices were raised as work was performed. All daily rates agreed with the Defendant on this and all our other contracts were ex-VAT. VAT has always been paid on top of the prices quoted. The position was completely understood by both parties and all invoices were paid on this basis throughout our relationship. For the first year of the 500 Days Contract, VAT was added to the daily rate of £850 (and paid) without protest.  
35. As the Contract term progressed, the monthly spreadsheets and our internal records showed that, although we had provided substantial consultancy work, a significant balance of the minimum days remained unused. Under the Contract, DCLG was nevertheless obliged to purchase and pay for those days, whether or not they chose to call off the services.  
36. On that basis, and in accordance with the Contract, E-Nik raised two invoices which are the subject of these proceedings: a. Invoice dated 9 May 2011 – this invoice covered the unused balance of the minimum 500 days for Year 1 (1 April 2009–31 March 2010\) and Year 2 (1 April 2010–31 March 2011), priced at £850 per day, together with VAT as then applicable. The invoice stated that payment was due within 30 days. b. Invoice dated 25 October 2011 – this invoice covered the unused balance of the 250-day minimum for the half-year from 1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011, again at £850 per day plus VAT, with payment due within 30 days.  
37. The total principal sum claimed under those two invoices is £760,920, which figure includes VAT. The underlying calculation is based on the contractual minimum number of days over the full 2½-year term, less the consultancy days actually supplied and already paid for.  
38. DCLG has not paid any part of the sums claimed in the invoices dated 9 May 2011 and 25 October 2011\. The invoices clearly identified: the period to which they related; the number of days being charged; the £850 daily rate; and the total amount claimed.  
39. In my view DCLG had full notice, from those dates, of the amount of the debt we claimed was due. At no time has DCLG suggested that E-Nik failed to make consultancy services available during the term of the Contract. Their position has instead been that, because of the closure of the GOR and their internal decisions on project requirements, they say they should not have to pay for the full minimum number of days. As set out above, that is inconsistent with both the contractual wording and the contemporaneous documents.

**H. Continuing availability until expiry of the Contract**

40. For the avoidance of doubt, E-Nik did not accept any suggestion that DCLG’s decision not to call off services amounted to a termination or repudiation of the Contract.  
41. We continued to treat the Contract as subsisting and maintained the necessary consultancy capacity up to and including 30 September 2011, when the fixed term expired. In commercial terms this meant that we turned down or deferred other potential work so as to ensure that we could meet any request from DCLG under the Contract for the minimum days purchased.

**I. Statement of truth**

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
