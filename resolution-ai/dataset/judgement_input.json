        "undisputed_facts": "Both parties accept there is a written contract dated 1 April 2009 containing Clause 2.1 with the wording \"minimum of 500 days... based on project requirement\" and that the Contract ran to 30 September 2011 (Claimant §3-6; Defence §1).",
        "claimant_position": "The Clause creates an absolute obligation to purchase and pay for a minimum of 500 days per year. The Claimant relies on the wording \"minimum\", the 12—month termination notice (Clause 8.1) which would be commercially pointless if the Defendant could buy zero days, invoicing of fees \"yearly in advance\" (Appendix 2), reporting obligations showing \"days remaining\" indicating a fixed pot, and pre—contract emails where Mr Bentley confirmed \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year\" (Claimant §7-10; Documents N, C, L, E, F, G).",
        "defendant_position": "The Defendant says the obligation was expressly qualified by the words \"based on project requirement\", meaning it was conditional: if the Defendant's projects did not require the days, it was not bound to buy them. The Defendant also submits the pre-contract email relied on by the Claimant is irrelevant because the critical qualification words were inserted into the final Contract after that email; and the closure of GOR reduced or removed project requirements (Defence §2(a)-(c), §3; Document A).",
        "legal_issue": "Did Clause 2.1 impose an absolute, contractual obligation on the Defendant to purchase 500 days per year, or did the qualification \"based on project requirement\" make the obligation conditional? Relatedly, what weight (if any) should be given to the pre—contract emails (12/15 May 2009) and the commercial matrix (Appendix 2, reporting) when construing Clause 2.1?",

      "recommendation": "Micro-verdict: On the materials provided, Clause 2.1 as executed — containing the words \"minimum of 500 days... based on project requirement\" — creates a genuine interpretive tension. The single word \"minimum\" and commercial features relied on by the Claimant (12-month termination notice Clause 8.1, invoicing \"yearly in advance\" in Appendix 2, reporting showing \"days remaining\", and a pre-contract email where Mr Bentley said \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year\") support the Claimant's case for an absolute annual purchase obligation (Claimant §7-10; Documents N, C, E, F, G). However, the express qualifying phrase \"based on project requirement\" in the executed contract supports the Defendant's contention that the obligation was conditional on actual project need (Defence §2(a)-(c); Defence §1; Document A). Applying the unitary/contextual approach in Rainy Sky S.A. v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50 (Lord Clarke, 2 Nov 2011) — \"the exercise of construction is essentially one unitary exercise in which the court must consider the language used and ascertain what a reasonable person... would have understood the parties to have meant\" — the presence of the qualifying language in the final written clause is a strong textual indicator that the obligation may be conditional unless persuasive contextual evidence displaces it. As summarised in Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36 (27 May 2015), courts should give words their natural meaning but may prefer the construction consistent with business common sense where more than one meaning is open. On balance, and without further factual verification, the Defendant's conditional construction is textually stronger on the face of the executed contract, but material uncertainty remains because (a) the timing and drafting history (whether the qualification was inserted after the pre-contract emails) is not established (Defence §2(b)), and (b) the parties' course of performance (invoices, purchase orders, use of days, and reconciliation/reporting) that could demonstrate a practical fixed \"pot\" is not shown.

Under the controlling unitary approach to construction the court will read the language in its full factual and commercial matrix (see Rainy Sky S.A. v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50, 2 Nov 2011: \"the court must consider the language used and ascertain what a reasonable person... would have understood the parties to have meant\").\n\nKey points of application to the present materials:\n- Textual primacy: If the precise syntax shows the qualifier grammatically attaches to \"minimum\" (or otherwise qualifies the operative obligation), the Defendant's conditional construction is the natural reading; if the grammar leaves \"minimum\" unqualified, the Claimant's literal construction is stronger (see Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36, 26 Mar 2015: \"the language of the contract [is] put firmly back into the spotlight\").\n- Commercial common sense: Where two readings are plausible the court may prefer the construction consistent with business common sense (Rainy Sky). The Claimant's commercial indicators (12-month termination notice, yearly-in-advance invoicing in Appendix 2, reporting showing \"days remaining\") support an annual fixed pot (Claimant ¶7-10; Documents N, C). The Defendant's factual point that project requirements fell away (closure of GOR) bears on whether conditioning the obligation to actual requirement is commercially sensible (Defence ¶2(c); Document A).\n- Pre-contract emails: Pre-contract assurances (e.g. Mr Bentley's emails on 12/15 May 2009) are part of the factual matrix but have limited weight if they conflict with the final written text or pre-date an express qualification inserted into the executed contract (Claimant ¶9; Defence ¶2(b)). Authorities establish caution in relying on negotiation emails as interpretive aids (see Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, 7 Oct 2009; Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381).\n\nEvidential gaps preventing a reliable micro-verdict: the exact verbatim wording and punctuation of Clause 2.1 (and immediate context), drafting history showing whether/when \"based on project requirement\" was inserted, full Appendix 2 text and actual invoices/payments, the \"days remaining\" reports, and contemporaneous evidence about how the parties operated the contract in practice are not supplied. Because these facts are material to the unitary contextual exercise, a final recommendation cannot be reached on the present record.\n\nAuthorities relied on (full references):\n- Rainy Sky S.A. v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50 (2 November 2011).\n- Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36 (26 March 2015).\n- Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38 (7 October 2009).\n- Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381.",
          "suggestion": "Essential next steps (required to reach >60% confidence): obtain the full verbatim Clause 2.1 and immediately surrounding clauses (to determine grammatical attachment of \"based on project requirement\"); obtain draft versions/track-change history and negotiation emails showing when the qualifier was inserted (to test the Defence assertion it post-dates the pre-contract emails); obtain full Appendix 2, actual invoices/payments, and the \"days remaining\" reports and any minutes/witness statements showing course of performance; obtain documents about the GOR closure and contemporaneous communications. Also research and analyse authorities on (a) weight of pre-contractual emails in construction (Chartbrook; Prenn), (b) the unitary/contextual approach and commercial common sense (Rainy Sky; Arnold), and (c) cases on qualifying expressions like \"based on [X] requirement\" and when they create conditions versus scope limitations.

          "recommendation": "Recommendation (synthesising all provided micro‑verdicts and documents)\n\nShort answer (neutral): On the materials provided I cannot conclude with confidence (>60%) whether Clause 2.1 imposed an absolute contractual obligation to purchase 500 days per year or whether the words “based on project requirement” made that obligation conditional. The written contract language and the contemporaneous / operational documents point in both directions. Further targeted documentary and legal work is required before a reliable construction conclusion can be given.\n\nWhy I reach that position (synthesis of the evidence)\n\n1. The operative contractual text (Clause 2.1) contains both an apparently absolute term and an express qualifier.\n- Clause 2.1 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES.md / Quote 1):\n  \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\"\n- This single sentence contains: (a) the word “minimum” (supporting the Claimant’s literal reading of an annual floor) and (b) the immediate phrase “based on project requirement” (relied on by the Defendant as an express qualifier). Which part of the sentence the qualifier grammatically and functionally attaches to is the decisive textual question.\n\n2. Related contractual provisions and appendices provide contextual evidence that pulls both ways.\n- Clause 2.2 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT / Quote 11): \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" This call‑off mechanism supports an individual requisition/assignment model.\n- Clause 2.3 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT / Quote 2): \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes...\" (ties payment to Assignment Notes and call‑offs).\n- Clause 3.8 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT / Quote 4): \"Supplier is obliged to provide concise accounts of resources used on a monthly basis as an excel document which shows work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased.\" Reporting language is consistent with a pre‑purchased bank of days being tracked.\n- Clause 8.1 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT / Quote 6): \"This Agreement shall commence on 1 April 2009 and continue until 30 September 2011. This Agreement is terminable by 12 months written notice...\" The 12‑month notice provision is cited by Claimant as supporting a fixed annual commitment (arguing a 12‑month termination provision would be commercially pointless if Defendant could buy zero days).\n- Appendix 2 (FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT / Quote 7): \"Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" If Appendix 2 does (in fact) require yearly‑in‑advance invoicing, that is strong contextual support for a purchased annual pot — but Appendix 2 as supplied in the materials is not fully conclusive by itself.\n\n3. Operational documents and invoices give mixed signals.\n- Supplier ledger / monthly spreadsheet (C - E-Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.csv / Quote 1): \"This sheet provides the monthly consultancy‑day usage and remaining minimum commitment used to calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices.\" The spreadsheet records Annual_Minimum_Days = 500 for Year 1 and Year 2 (Document C Quotes 4 and 6) and then shows Annual_Minimum_Days = 250 for the “Final 6 months” (Document C Quote 8). This shows how the supplier treated the contract in practice (it used a minimum‑days accounting model and prepared reconciliation invoices) and thus is probative on construction if the spreadsheet was relied upon/accepted by the Defendant.\n- Reconciliation invoice (K - Invoice (disputed 1).md / Invoice Quote 3–5): Invoice K expressly asserts a \"Minimum Annual Commitment: 500 Days\" and calculates a shortfall charge (e.g. charging 496 days at £850/day). That supports the Claimant’s factual position that unpaid minimum‑usage invoices were issued.\n- Monthly delivery invoice (I - Invoice (1).md / Invoice Quotes 5–8): shows invoicing for days actually delivered in a month (e.g. \"Total Days Delivered: 48 Days Daily Rate: £850.00\") and is silent on any cross‑reference to an annual advance PO. This pattern (if repeated) points toward a consumption/call‑off billing model, which supports the Defendant’s construction in practice.\n\n4. Pre‑contract emails and minutes are part of the factual matrix but have limited and conditional weight.\n- Pre‑contract emails: Document F (Email - 12 May 2009) sought confirmation \"please could you confirm that the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year\" and Document E (Email - 15 May 2009) replied: \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik’s engagement for work.\" These emails evidence contemporaneous expectations. However, the Defendant says the executed contract contains the qualifying phrase inserted after those emails; if true, the emails’ interpretive weight is reduced because they conflict with the final written wording. Under the unitary/contextual approach (Rainy Sky; Arnold) pre‑contract communications form part of the matrix but cannot displace clear written language.\n- Minutes (L - Minutes of Meeting.md / Quotes 1–3) record operational instructions to continue services after the GOR announcement and that \"E‑Nik Ltd to maintain current resource availability and continue delivery of support for GO ICT Systems.\" These minutes support that services continued and that the supplier kept resources available — factually relevant to reliance and course of performance — but they do not by themselves show a contractual legal obligation to pay for unused days.\n\n5. Departmental policy (GOR closure) affects the factual matrix but is not contractual text.\n- Document A (Closure of GOR.md / Quote 3–4) states the network \"will effectively cease operations by the end of March 2011\" and that functions \"will be reviewed\" with decisions on continuation/suspension of specific project requirements. That fact supports the Defendant’s contention that project requirements reduced or disappeared, which bears on whether a \"based on project requirement\" limitation would operate in practice. But the circular does not itself answer the grammatical/textual construction question.\n\n6. Net assessment and conclusion\n- Textual tension is decisive and unresolved on the supplied materials. The executed Clause 2.1 sentence quoted above simultaneously supports both readings: the presence of the word \"minimum\" points to an annual floor, while the immediately following \"based on project requirement\" can — depending on punctuation/attachment and commercial context — either qualify that floor or describe how purchased days will be applied.\n- The surrounding contractual mechanics (Assignment Notes, per‑day rates, reporting obligations and Appendix 2 invoicing language) are relevant but are currently ambivalent because the documentary practice (some monthly delivery invoices; some supplier reconciliation invoices) is inconsistent across the bundle.\n- The pre‑contract emails and minutes are relevant parts of the commercial matrix but cannot override or conclusively fix the construction where the final written text contains an express qualifier unless drafting history or course of performance shows otherwise.\n\nTherefore: I maintain the provisional micro‑verdict given previously — the materials as supplied do not allow me to say with >60% confidence whether Clause 2.1 created an absolute annual obligation to pay for 500 days or a conditional, requirement‑based obligation. This is a balanced, evidence‑driven conclusion, not a determination of which party is right.\n\nKey documents and relevant quotes relied on in this synthesis (samples)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES.md (Document G), Clause 2.1: \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\" (Quote 1)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G), Clause 2.2: \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" (Quote 11)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G), Clause 2.3: \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes...\" (Quote 2)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G), Clause 3.8: \"Supplier is obliged to provide concise accounts of resources used on a monthly basis as an excel document which shows work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased.\" (Quote 4)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G), Clause 8.1: \"This Agreement shall commence on 1 April 2009 and continue until 30 September 2011. This Agreement is terminable by 12 months written notice...\" (Quote 6)\n- FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G), Appendix 2: \"Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (Quote 7)\n- E‑Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.csv (Document C): \"This sheet provides the monthly consultancy‑day usage and remaining minimum commitment used to calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices.\" (Quote 1); entries record Annual_Minimum_Days = 500 for Years 1 & 2 (Quotes 4 and 6) and 250 for Final 6 months (Quote 8).\n- Email - 15 May 2009.md (Document E): \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik’s engagement for work.\" (Quote 1)\n- Email - 12 May 2009.md (Document F): request: \"please could you confirm that the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year\" (Quote 1)\n- Invoice (disputed 1) (Document K): invoice heading \"Minimum Annual Commitment: 500 Days\" and calculates shortfall (Invoice Quotes 2–5).\n- Invoice (1) (Document I): month invoice showing \"Total Days Delivered: 48 Days Daily Rate: £850.00\" (Invoice Quotes 5–8) — example of monthly delivery billing.\n- Minutes of Meeting (Document L): notes that \"E‑Nik’s view that current projects 'involve a broader scope beyond the GOR and should remain unaffected by the announcement'\" and action \"E‑Nik Ltd to maintain current resource availability...\" (L Quotes 1–3).\n\nWhat would change the balance (briefly):\n- If the executed contract page (with exact punctuation and immediate surrounding clauses) shows the qualifier grammatically attaches to and limits the operative \"undertakes to purchase\" clause, that would make the Defendant’s construction the natural grammatical reading. Conversely, if punctuation/lineation shows the qualifier is descriptive or attaches to a different part of the sentence, the Claimant’s literal minimum reading strengthens.\n- If Appendix 2 unambiguously requires \"yearly in advance\" invoicing and there is documentary evidence (POs, Fujitsu→Supplier invoices and Customer→Fujitsu invoices, and ledger entries) showing the parties actually issued and accepted yearly advance payments equal to the 500‑day cost, the Claimant’s position on a contractual annual pot would be materially strengthened by course of performance.\n- If drafting history (tracked drafts, redlines, negotiations) shows \"based on project requirement\" was inserted into the final executed text after the May 2009 emails, that reduces the interpretive weight of those emails.\n\nConclusion: maintain the earlier micro‑verdict — unresolved (>60% confidence not reached). The precise grammatical construction of Clause 2.1 and the documentary history and course of performance are determinative but currently incompletely evidenced.\n\n",
          "suggestion": "Very important next steps (documentary and legal research priorities)\n\nDocuments to obtain and examine (priority order and why each is essential):\n1. Executed FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT full pages including signature page — extract the exact, verbatim Clause 2.1 and immediate surrounding clauses (include punctuation, line breaks and headings). Rationale: grammatical attachment of \"based on project requirement\" to the operative obligation is the decisive textual question. (Contract‑priority rule: treat contract as primary source; quote the clause when relying on it.)\n2. Appendix 2 (executed version) in full and any invoicing/PO templates referred to in the Appendix. Rationale: the Appendix’s exact wording about \"yearly in advance\" invoicing and PO flow is highly probative of intended billing mechanics.\n3. Drafting history / tracked redlines of the Framework Agreement and the negotiation email chain (including the 12/15 May 2009 emails and any subsequent exchange) showing whether/when the phrase \"based on project requirement\" was introduced. Rationale: these documents test whether the pre‑contract assurances were superseded by the executed wording.\n4. Native monthly reporting spreadsheet(s) (Document C original .xlsx with metadata) showing \"days used/days remaining/days purchased\" and the email circulation trail showing who prepared/approved them. Rationale: confirms provenance of the ledger used to calculate minimum‑usage invoices.\n5. Complete set of Purchase Orders (Customer→Fujitsu and Fujitsu→Supplier), all supplier invoices (including disputed Invoice K and T), Fujitsu invoices to the Customer, and the payment ledger (Document M). Rationale: shows whether parties invoiced/paid annually in advance or invoiced monthly/for actual days and whether reconciliation invoices were accepted or disputed.\n6. Any signed variations, 12‑month termination notices, or formal communications invoking Clause 8.1 during 2009–2011. Rationale: shows whether parties formally varied the contract or gave notice rather than relying on the minimum clause.\n7. Internal DCLG / Fujitsu communications and minutes around the GOR closure (Document A and follow‑ups) evidencing decisions about suspension/cancellation of project work and procurement/budget actions. Rationale: informs the factual matrix on whether project requirement persisted.\n8. Witness statements from the contract negotiators (authors of the May 2009 emails), the procurement officers who dealt with POs/invoices, and the spreadsheet author(s). Rationale: targeted evidence on drafting chronology and course of performance.\n\nCase‑law / legal research directions (very important):\n1. Re‑read and extract passages on the unitary/contextual approach and commercial common sense: Rainy Sky S.A. v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50; Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36; Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896. Purpose: to frame the interpretive method and the weight to give to commercial common sense vs textual primacy.\n2. Research authorities on use and weight of pre‑contractual emails/negotiations in interpretation and when they are displaced by later written changes: Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38; Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381. Purpose: to structure argument on whether Mr Bentley’s emails should be relied upon.\n3. Search for cases interpreting qualifying phrases in minimum‑purchase clauses (keywords: \"minimum purchase\", \"based on project requirement\", \"subject to project requirement\", \"conditional minimum\"). Purpose: identify authorities where courts treated similar qualifiers as conditions precedent versus mere scope descriptions.\n4. Research case law on course of performance and invoicing practice as an aid to interpretation (keywords: \"course of performance\", \"course of dealing\", \"conduct as aid to interpretation\", \"reconciliation invoices\"). Purpose: to assess when consistent invoicing/payment practice can tilt an ambiguity toward one interpretation.\n\nTactical priorities for discovery and litigation strategy\n- First priority: obtain the executed Clause 2.1 (item 1 above) and Appendix 2 (item 2). These are most likely to decide the textual question.\n- Second priority: drafting history and the native spreadsheet + invoices/payment ledger (items 3–5). These will show whether parties actually followed an annual advance billing model or a call‑off consumption model.\n- If documentary practice shows advance POs/invoices for 500 days were issued and accepted/paid, focus on enforcing/reconciling those payments. If documentary practice shows only monthly invoicing and no accepted reconciliation invoices, focus on defending/rebutting the Claimant’s minimum‑usage invoices.\n\nIf any of the above documents cannot be produced, prepare focused witness evidence to explain the drafting chronology and operational practice (who drafted/approved Appendix 2, who authorised POs/invoices, who prepared the spreadsheet and why).",

          "recommendation": "Short answer (neutral; no change to earlier recommendation):\nI maintain the earlier provisional conclusion — on the materials supplied I cannot say with >60% confidence whether Clause 2.1 created an absolute contractual obligation to purchase 500 days per year or whether the phrase “based on project requirement” qualified that obligation so it was conditional. The executed contract language contains both an express “minimum” and an immediate qualifying phrase in the same operative sentence, and the parties’ subsequent documents and conduct point in both directions. This is a provisional, evidence‑driven position, not a determination of which party is right.\n\nWhy I reach that position (synthesis of the document micro‑verdicts and key quotes relied on):\n1) The single decisive textual sentence in the contract is internally ambiguous.  Clause 2.1 in the executed Framework Agreement (Document G) states verbatim:  \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\" (Document G — Clause 2.1). That sentence contains the word \"minimum\" (supporting a literal annual floor) and immediately thereafter the phrase \"based on project requirement\" (relied on by the Defendant as an express limitation). The grammatico‑functional attachment of the qualifier to the undertaking (or not) is the controlling question and is not resolved by the supplied bundle.\n\n2) The contract mechanics provide relevant but ambivalent context.  I rely on the following contractual provisions quoted verbatim from Document G when considering context:\n- Clause 2.2: \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" (Document G — Clause 2.2).\n- Clause 2.3: \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes...\" (Document G — Clause 2.3).\n- Clause 3.8: \"Supplier is obliged to provide concise accounts of resources used on a monthly basis as an excel document which shows work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased.\" (Document G — Clause 3.8).\n- Clause 8.1: \"This Agreement shall commence on 1 April 2009 and continue until 30 September 2011. This Agreement is terminable by 12 months written notice...\" (Document G — Clause 8.1).\n- Appendix 2 (as supplied): \"Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (Document G — Appendix 2).\nThese clauses can be read to support either party. Clause 2.2/2.3 (assignment note / payment subject to assignment notes) supports a call‑off/assignment model (Defendant). Clause 3.8 and Appendix 2 (reporting of \"days purchased\" and the \"yearly in advance\" wording) support a pre‑purchased tracked pot (Claimant) — but the bundle does not conclusively show that Appendix 2 was implemented in practice as an annual prepaid flow.\n\n3) The parties’ post‑contract documents and invoicing practice are mixed and therefore inconclusive:\n- Supplier operational accounting: E‑Nik’s spreadsheet (Document C — E‑Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.xlsx) states: \"This sheet provides the monthly consultancy‑day usage and remaining minimum commitment used to calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices.\" and records Annual_Minimum_Days = 500 for Year 1 and Year 2 (Document C Quotes). That shows the supplier operationally treated a 500‑day minimum and used it to prepare reconciliation invoices.\n- Reconciliation/shortfall invoicing: Invoice (disputed 1) (Document K) is headed \"Minimum Annual Commitment: 500 Days\" and calculates a shortfall charge (Document K). That supports the Claimant’s factual position that minimum‑usage invoices were issued.\n- Delivery invoices: other supplier invoices (e.g. Document I — Invoice (1).md and Document J — Year 2 Quarterly Invoice) show invoicing for days actually delivered (e.g. \"Total Days Delivered: 48 Days\" or \"Total Days Delivered: 125 Days\"), with no explicit reference to an annual 500‑day pot in those invoices. That pattern supports the Defendant’s consumption/call‑off view.\n- Payment ledger: the ledger (Document M) shows paid delivery invoices and UNPAID reconciliation invoices (Document M quotes), which indicates that even where supplier sought to enforce a minimum in practice, those reconciliation invoices were contested or unpaid. That mixed payment response reduces the probative value of supplier unilateral reconciliation invoices as conclusive evidence of a contractual annual obligation.\n\n4) Pre‑contract communications and minutes form part of the factual matrix but do not displace the executed text on the present record:\n- Emails (Documents F and E): 12 May 2009 request \"please could you confirm that the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year\" (Document F) and 15 May 2009 reply \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik’s engagement for work.\" (Document E). These contemporaneous statements show a Claimant expectation but the Defendant maintains the final qualifying words were inserted after these emails (Defence §2(a)–(c)). Under the unitary/contextual approach these emails are admissible context but cannot override clear final written language; here the final wording itself is ambiguous, so the emails are relevant but not dispositive.\n- Minutes (Document L): record operational directions such as \"E‑Nik Ltd to maintain current resource availability and continue delivery of support for GO ICT Systems.\" (Document L Quotes). The minutes evidence reliance and continuation of service but do not themselves decide contractual character of Clause 2.1.\n\n5) External factual events are material to how a qualifier would operate but do not determine clause construction.  The GOR closure notice (Document A) states operations \"will effectively cease operations by the end of March 2011\" and that specific project requirements \"will be reviewed\" (Document A Quotes). That supports the Defendant’s factual case that project requirements reduced, making a project‑requirement qualifier operational — but it does not resolve the grammatical/contractual question.\n\n6) The key evidential and legal forks that would change the balance are clear: (a) the executed contract page(s) with exact punctuation/lineation and signature showing where \"based on project requirement\" sits on the page; (b) native Appendix 2 and the PO/invoicing flow showing whether \"yearly in advance\" invoices were issued and accepted; (c) drafting history/redlines showing whether the qualifier was inserted after the May 2009 emails (affecting weight of those emails); and (d) the native spreadsheet(s)/metadata, Assignment Notes, POs and payment ledger showing whether the parties actually operated a prepaid 500‑day pot or a month‑by‑month call‑off model. These evidential items are missing or incomplete in the supplied bundle and are decisive for construction.\n\nNet assessment/conclusion: the same provisional micro‑verdict stands — because clause 2.1 contains both an express \"minimum\" and an immediate qualification and course of performance is mixed, I cannot say with >60% confidence which construction should prevail on the current documents. Further documentary and targeted legal work is necessary before a reliable construction conclusion can be given.",
          "suggestion": "This next stage of work is essential (without these items the construction question cannot be reached with >60% confidence). Prioritised documentary and legal research steps (very important):\n\nDocuments to obtain and examine (in priority order and why):\n1. Executed Framework Agreement (native/signed page(s)) showing Clause 2.1 exactly as executed (including punctuation, line breaks and signature page). Rationale: the grammatical/lineation attachment of \"based on project requirement\" to the operative undertaking is the decisive textual question. (Document G — Clause 2.1 quoted: \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\")\n2. Executed Appendix 2 (native) and any invoicing/PO templates it references. Rationale: the Appendix’s exact wording about \"yearly in advance\" and how invoices/POs should flow is highly probative of whether an annual prepaid pot was intended and implemented. (Document G — Appendix 2 quote: \"Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\")\n3. Drafting history (tracked drafts/redlines) and the full negotiation email chain (including the 12 & 15 May 2009 emails — Documents F and E). Rationale: to test whether \"based on project requirement\" was inserted into the final text after the May emails (which would reduce the emails’ interpretive weight). Relevant email quote: Document E (15 May 2009): \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik’s engagement for work.\" Document F (12 May 2009): request \"please could you confirm that the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year\".\n4. Native monthly reporting spreadsheet(s) (Document C .xlsx) with metadata/edit history and the email trail showing circulation/acknowledgement. Rationale: to verify provenance of the supplier’s reconciliation and whether the Authority accepted the spreadsheet figures (Document C states: \"This sheet provides the monthly consultancy‑day usage and remaining minimum commitment used to calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices.\").\n5. Complete PO/Assignment Note trail and invoicing/payment records: Customer→Fujitsu POs, Fujitsu→Supplier POs, all supplier invoices (including disputed Invoice K and Invoice T), Fujitsu invoices to the Customer, payment ledger and remittance advices. Rationale: to determine whether yearly advance POs/invoices equal to the 500‑day cost were issued/accepted and whether shortfall invoices were ever paid. (Document K — invoice heading: \"Minimum Annual Commitment: 500 Days\").\n6. Any signed variations, termination notices, or formal communications invoking Clause 8.1 during the contract term. Rationale: to see whether parties varied or relied on termination mechanics rather than the minimum‑days clause.\n7. Witness statements (negotiators and procurement officers): Mr Bentley, Ms Dawett, procurement officers and the spreadsheet author. Rationale: to explain drafting chronology, authority of pre‑contract assurances, and whether the Authority acknowledged/accepted reconciliation invoices and the spreadsheet.\n\nCase‑law / legal research priorities (very important):\n1. Re‑read and extract leading passages on the unitary/contextual approach and on when commercial common sense may be applied: Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50; Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36; Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896. Purpose: to frame the interpretive method and the weight to give to the written text vs. the commercial matrix.\n2. Research authorities on the weight of pre‑contractual emails/drafting history in interpretation and when they are displaced by later written changes: Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38; Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749; and relevant authorities on drafting chronology.\n3. Search for cases construing qualifying phrases in minimum‑purchase clauses (keywords: \"minimum purchase\"; \"based on project requirement\"; \"subject to project requirement\"). Purpose: identify decisions where courts treated similar qualifiers as conditions precedent or as descriptive scope language.\n4. Research authorities on course of performance and invoicing practice as an aid to interpretation (keywords: \"course of performance\"; \"conduct as aid to interpretation\"). Purpose: assess when consistent invoicing/payment practice can tip an ambiguity toward one construction.\n\nImmediate tactical priorities on receipt of documents:\n- First obtain the executed Clause 2.1 page(s) and Appendix 2 (items 1–2). These are most likely to determine the textual/grammatical construction.\n- Then obtain drafting history and the native spreadsheet + PO/invoice/payment ledger (items 3–5). If those show yearly advance POs/invoices were issued and accepted, that will materially strengthen Claimant’s case; if they show assignment notes/requisition issues and only pay‑as‑delivered invoices were accepted, that will strengthen Defendant’s construction.\n\nIf any of the high‑priority documents cannot be produced, prepare focussed witness evidence addressing the specific gaps (timing of insertion of the qualifier; whether Appendix 2 was followed; whether the spreadsheet and reconciliation invoices were accepted).",

      "recommendation": "Micro-verdict (issue: debt v damages; mitigation; penalty challenge)\n\nShort answer: On the present materials I cannot conclude the Claimant is entitled as of right to recover the contracted price as a debt. The Claimant has a plausible White & Carter election only if it can prove (A) it could validly perform unilaterally (performance did not require further active cooperation from the Defendant) and (B) it in fact kept resources \"ready, willing and able\" to perform and had a contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest in keeping the contract alive. If either element is not established, the normal remedy is damages and the Claimant will be subject to the duty to mitigate. The Defendant's penalty challenge to Clause 2.1 also remains live and requires proportionality analysis.\n\nReasoning and citations to the provided materials:\n- Legal rule: White & Carter permits an innocent party to elect to perform and recover the agreed contract price as a debt where the claimant could validly and meaningfully perform unilaterally and in fact performed or stood ready to perform: White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1965] AC 617 (see Lord Reid’s formulation quoted in the materials). The materials provided to me invoke that principle (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). Full reference: White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1965] AC 617.\n- Legitimate-interest limitation: Subsequent authority (as relied on in your notes) requires a contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest in keeping the contract alive; an election is not permitted where the claimant had no such interest (see MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015) quoted in your micro-verdicts). Full reference: MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015). The notes quote: \"it may well be that, if it can be shown that a person has no legitimate interest, financial or otherwise, in performing the contract rather than claiming damages, he ought not to be allowed to saddle the other party with an additional burden with no benefit to himself\" and \"an innocent party can only be said to have no legitimate interest ... if (a) damages are an adequate remedy and (b) maintaining the contract would be 'wholly unreasonable'.\"\n- Application to the pleaded facts:\n  - Claimant relies on being \"ready, willing and able\" and points to contemporaneous documents (Document B — 15 Apr 2011 email, Document L — minutes 17 Dec 2010, Document S — witness statement) and invoices (K, T) (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). The Claimant asserts an election (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18).\n  - Defendant denies the debt characterization, contends performance required Defendant cooperation (Defence ¶5) so remedy is damages, and pleads mitigation and strict proof of availability (Defence ¶5, ¶6). The Defendant also asserts that, if Clause 2.1 imposes payment for unused days, it would be an unenforceable penalty (Defence ¶6).\n  - On the materials provided the pivotal factual issues are not resolved: (i) the operative contract wording and Clause 2.1 (not provided), (ii) whether performance could be implemented unilaterally by the Claimant or required active cooperation from the Defendant (Not specified), and (iii) contemporaneous operational evidence that consultants were kept available (e.g. timesheets, retention payments) beyond the asserted documents (Not specified).\n- Burdens and mitigation: If the claim is treated as damages, the Defendant bears the evidential burden to show steps the Claimant could reasonably have taken to mitigate (per MSC v Cottonex quoted in your notes). If a valid liquidated-damages clause applies to the unpaid sums, mitigation arguments may not reduce that contractual sum.\n- Penalty challenge: The Defendant’s penalty argument to Clause 2.1 is unresolved on present materials. The modern approach requires assessing whether the sum is a genuine pre-estimate or is disproportionate to the legitimate interest protected (the notes point to MSC v Cottonex guidance). Whether Clause 2.1 is primary/price or a secondary/compensatory obligation is decisive (Not specified).\n\nImmediate practical implications on the issue:\n- If Claimant proves unilateral performability and contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest + contemporaneous evidence of availability (Documents B, L, S and operational proof), the court may allow an election under White & Carter and treat the unpaid minimum as a debt (subject to the legitimate-interest/penalty limits cited in MSC v Cottonex [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015)).\n- If Claimant cannot prove those elements and performance required Defendant cooperation, the correct remedy is damages, and the Claimant will be required to prove loss and mitigation.

          "recommendation": "Micro‑verdict (work in progress): On the materials supplied, I do not recommend treating the Claimant's pleaded entitlement to recover the contracted price as a straightforward debt recoverable without more. The Claimant expressly relies on an election-to‑affirm theory (invoking White & Carter) and on being \"ready, willing and able\" (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18; Documents B, L, S; Invoices K, T). The Defendant contests the debt characterisation and says the correct remedy is damages, engaging mitigation and strict proof of availability (Defence ¶5–6). Legal authorities supplied in your notes point to three controlling constraints that weigh against the debt route on the present record: (a) the White & Carter principle allowing an innocent party to sue for the contract price is narrow and requires that the claimant could validly perform (or already performed) without the defendant's further cooperation and that the election is not an improper attempt to coerce payment (White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413); (b) the claimant must have a contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest in keeping the contract alive and concrete evidence of a realistic prospect of performance (MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm), 12 February 2015 — esp. the \"legitimate interest\" passages and the warning that keeping contracts alive solely to claim sums may be unreasonable); and (c) where a clause is compensatory (liquidated damages) mitigation may not apply, but whether Clause 2.1 is a primary payable obligation or a secondary/penal provision requires construction and application of the modern penalty test (Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi; ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis [2015] UKSC 67). Applying those principles neutrally to the record: (1) the operative contract text (Clause 2.1) is Not specified — this is decisive for both the debt/ damages characterisation and the penalty question; (2) there is no contemporaneous evidence in the materials that the Claimant actually performed, incurred demonstrable reliance costs, or had an objectively reasonable, contemporaneous \"legitimate interest\" in keeping consultants on hold beyond asserting availability (Not specified); (3) there is no clear contemporaneous evidence of a repudiatory refusal or of the Defendant's conduct that would permit unilateral performance without cooperation (Not specified); and (4) the Defendant's penalty argument is plausible but cannot be resolved without the clause text and commercial context (Not specified). Conclusion: on the supplied record the safer characterisation is that the Claimant presently has a damages claim subject to mitigation and proof of availability, not an established immediate debt. The debt/election strategy remains possible in principle but requires proof of the narrow White & Carter conditions and of a legitimate interest (see White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413; MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm), 12 February 2015; Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi; ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis [2015] UKSC 67; British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd [1912] AC 673).",

(3) Collect contemporaneous evidence of mitigation efforts or re‑deployment of consultants (payroll records, offers to third parties, refused engagements). (4) If pursuing the debt route, prepare evidence to show the Claimant could validly continue performance without Defendant cooperation and had a contemporaneous legitimate interest (MSC Cottonex). (5) If defending, focus on requiring strict proof of availability and mitigation and on testing Clause 2.1 under the modern penalty test (Cavendish/Makdessi; ParkingEye).

          "recommendation": "Micro-verdict (issue: debt v damages; mitigation; penalty challenge)\n\nShort answer: On the present materials I cannot conclude the Claimant is entitled as of right to recover the contracted price as a debt. The Claimant has a plausible White & Carter election only if it can prove (A) it could validly perform unilaterally (performance did not require further active cooperation from the Defendant) and (B) it in fact kept resources \"ready, willing and able\" to perform and had a contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest in keeping the contract alive. If either element is not established, the normal remedy is damages and the Claimant will be subject to the duty to mitigate. The Defendant's penalty challenge to Clause 2.1 also remains live and requires proportionality analysis.\n\nReasoning and citations to the provided materials:\n- Legal rule: White & Carter permits an innocent party to elect to perform and recover the agreed contract price as a debt where the claimant could validly and meaningfully perform unilaterally and in fact performed or stood ready to perform: White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1965] AC 617 (see Lord Reid’s formulation quoted in the materials). The materials provided to me invoke that principle (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). Full reference: White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1965] AC 617.\n- Legitimate-interest limitation: Subsequent authority (as relied on in your notes) requires a contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest in keeping the contract alive; an election is not permitted where the claimant had no such interest (see MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015) quoted in your micro-verdicts). Full reference: MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015). The notes quote: \"it may well be that, if it can be shown that a person has no legitimate interest, financial or otherwise, in performing the contract rather than claiming damages, he ought not to be allowed to saddle the other party with an additional burden with no benefit to himself\" and \"an innocent party can only be said to have no legitimate interest ... if (a) damages are an adequate remedy and (b) maintaining the contract would be 'wholly unreasonable'.\"\n- Application to the pleaded facts:\n  - Claimant relies on being \"ready, willing and able\" and points to contemporaneous documents (Document B — 15 Apr 2011 email, Document L — minutes 17 Dec 2010, Document S — witness statement) and invoices (K, T) (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). The Claimant asserts an election (Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18).\n  - Defendant denies the debt characterization, contends performance required Defendant cooperation (Defence ¶5) so remedy is damages, and pleads mitigation and strict proof of availability (Defence ¶5, ¶6). The Defendant also asserts that, if Clause 2.1 imposes payment for unused days, it would be an unenforceable penalty (Defence ¶6).\n  - On the materials provided the pivotal factual issues are not resolved: (i) the operative contract wording and Clause 2.1 (not provided), (ii) whether performance could be implemented unilaterally by the Claimant or required active cooperation from the Defendant (Not specified), and (iii) contemporaneous operational evidence that consultants were kept available (e.g. timesheets, retention payments) beyond the asserted documents (Not specified).\n- Burdens and mitigation: If the claim is treated as damages, the Defendant bears the evidential burden to show steps the Claimant could reasonably have taken to mitigate (per MSC v Cottonex quoted in your notes). If a valid liquidated-damages clause applies to the unpaid sums, mitigation arguments may not reduce that contractual sum.\n- Penalty challenge: The Defendant’s penalty argument to Clause 2.1 is unresolved on present materials. The modern approach requires assessing whether the sum is a genuine pre-estimate or is disproportionate to the legitimate interest protected (the notes point to MSC v Cottonex guidance). Whether Clause 2.1 is primary/price or a secondary/compensatory obligation is decisive (Not specified).\n\nImmediate practical implications on the issue:\n- If Claimant proves unilateral performability and contemporaneous legitimate commercial interest + contemporaneous evidence of availability (Documents B, L, S and operational proof), the court may allow an election under White & Carter and treat the unpaid minimum as a debt (subject to the legitimate-interest/penalty limits cited in MSC v Cottonex [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015)).\n- If Claimant cannot prove those elements and performance required Defendant cooperation, the correct remedy is damages, and the Claimant will be required to prove loss and mitigation. The Defendant’s penalty plea to Clause 2.1 remains a separate, live defence.\n\nAuthorities relied on (full references used in the analysis above):\n- White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1965] AC 617.\n- MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt [2015] EWHC 283 (Comm) (12 Feb 2015).\n\nKey quotations from the materials (for guidance):\n- \"it may well be that, if it can be shown that a person has no legitimate interest, financial or otherwise, in performing the contract rather than claiming damages, he ought not to be allowed to saddle the other party with an additional burden with no benefit to himself\" (MSC v Cottonex quoting Lord Reid in White & Carter, as cited in your notes).\n- \"The burden of proof is on the defendant to show that there were steps available to the claimant...and that it is reasonable to expect that someone in the claimant’s position would have taken those steps.\" (MSC v Cottonex, as cited in your notes).\n\nConclusion: The Claimant’s debt election is plausible but not established on the present record.

          "recommendation": "Recommendation (synthesis of micro‑verdicts and documents)\n\nSummary conclusion (working, neutral):\n- On the present documentary record the safer characterisation is that the Claimant currently appears to have a claim in damages (for the Defendant’s failure to requisition the contracted days) subject to the ordinary duties of mitigation and proof of availability, rather than an indisputable immediate debt recoverable without more. This confirms and refines the prior recommendation. I am not reversing that conclusion; I am clarifying that Clause 2.1 does appear in the Framework Agreement but, even with that clause, the narrow conditions that would allow an immediate debt/election under White & Carter are not demonstrated by the materials supplied. (See further, below, what evidence would change this position.)\n\nKey contract text relied on (contract is treated as the primary source):\n- Framework Agreement G — Clause 2.1 (Minimum Purchase Commitment): \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\" (Document: G - FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES.md — Clause 2.1 quote)\n- Framework Agreement G — Clause 2.2 (Requisition Process): \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" (Document: G — Clause 2.2 quote)\n- Framework Agreement G — Clause 2.3 (Fees and Rates): \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes for each change request. This rate may be revised upward at the time of issue of an Assignment Note to reflect the complexity of the Services requisitioned or the level of skill required for the provision of the Services.\" (Document: G — Clause 2.3 quote)\n- Framework Agreement G — Clause 2.4 (Payment Terms): \"Payment of the fees shall be made within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice from the Supplier.\" (Document: G — Clause 2.4 quote)\n- Framework Agreement G — Appendix 2 (PO/Invoicing Workflow): \"The Customer will raise a PO on Fujitsu for the full amount for the services including the paying agent fee.  Fujitsu will raise a PO upon the Supplier for the full service charges.  Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance.  The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (Document: G — Appendix 2 quote)\n- Framework Agreement G — Clause 3.8 (Reporting): \"Supplier is obliged to provide concise accounts of resources used on a monthly basis as an excel document which shows work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased.\" (Document: G — Clause 3.8 quote)\n\nWhy I reach the above conclusion (neutral analysis tied to documents):\n1) Clause 2.1 is express but qualified. The contract does contain an express minimum‑purchase clause: \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement ...\" (Document G — Clause 2.1). That is important and supports the Claimant’s position that a minimum was contracted. However, the clause is immediately qualified by the words \"based on project requirement\" and sits inside a framework that expressly requires call‑offs by Assignment Note (Document G — Clause 2.2) and contemplates assignment‑by‑assignment agreement on rates (Document G — Clause 2.3). Those features indicate the minimum was intended to operate in a call‑off/operational context, not necessarily as an unconditional, immediately payable “debt” independent of the requisition process. (Document G — Clauses 2.1–2.3.)\n\n2) The parties’ operational materials corroborate that the Claimant treated unused days as an accounting shortfall but do not prove the legal entitlement on their own. The Claimant’s internal ledger/spreadsheet (Document: C - E-Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.xlsx — Summary.csv) records it was used to \"calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices\" and shows Annual_Minimum_Days and Days_Remaining_This_Year entries (Document C — spreadsheet quotes). Invoices exist claiming the shortfall (Document: K - Invoice (disputed 1).md — Invoice K dated 9 May 2011 described as \"Contract Reconciliation – Year 2 … Charge for the balance of minimum purchased consultancy days not utilized by the Authority\" and calculating days at £850/day; Document: T - Invoice (disputed 2).md — Invoice T dated 25 Oct 2011). Those documents show how the Claimant quantified and demanded payment. But internal accounting and invoices alone do not displace the contract’s call‑off mechanics or establish the narrow legal prerequisites for suing for the contract price as an immediate debt.\n\n3) Contemporaneous communications support availability but are equivocal on unilateral entitlement and on incurred reliance costs. Minutes of 17 Dec 2010 record: \"Ms. Kate Kedge requested that enik continue providing services until advised otherwise\" and \"E‑Nik Ltd to maintain current resource availability and continue delivery of support for GO ICT Systems\" (Document L — Minutes quotes). The April 2011 email states work was \"suspended\" but \"not an indicator as to what happens next\" (Document B — 15 April 2011 email quote). The Claimant’s witness statement (Document S) asserts it \"stood ready, willing and able\" and references monthly reporting, but the witness statement does not itself attach contemporaneous payroll/timesheet evidence showing consultants were actually held on and that reliance costs were incurred. Thus the communications corroborate ongoing engagement but do not, on the present materials, show the objective, contemporaneous reliance or inability to mitigate required to satisfy the narrow White & Carter conditions. (Documents L, B, S.)\n\n4) White & Carter and modern authorities remain binding constraints. The Claimant expressly pleads an election‑to‑affirm strategy (O - Statement of Claim.md; Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). The law (White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor) permits suing for the contract price in narrow circumstances only where the claimant could validly perform without the defendant’s cooperation and where the claimant had a legitimate contemporaneous commercial interest in performing. Subsequent authorities (notably MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt) emphasise that this election is limited where the claimant’s real interest in keeping the contract alive is not demonstrated. Applying those legal constraints neutrally: the supplied record currently lacks the contemporaneous evidence (e.g. clear proof of unilateral performability, demonstrable reliance costs such as payroll obligations or turned‑down alternative work) that would make an immediate debt recovery under White & Carter secure. (See O, S, G, C, K, T, B, L.)\n\n5) The call‑off / PO / invoicing mechanics are central. Appendix 2 of the contract contemplates yearly‑in‑advance invoicing routed through Fujitsu and POs (Document G — Appendix 2 quote). Whether that mechanism in practice created an unconditional payable sum (a debt) or remained subject to assignment notes and acceptance is not proved on the present material. The invoices in the bundle do not show matching POs or clear acceptances, and the spreadsheet and invoices appear to be Claimant reconciliation documents rather than proof the Defendant accepted an unconditional debt. (Documents G, N, K, T, C.)\n\n6) Penalty point cannot be determined without clause construction and commercial context. The Defendant contends that, if Clause 2.1 is read to require payment for unused days irrespective of requisition, such an obligation could be an unenforceable penalty (P - Statement of Defence.md — Defence ¶6). Whether Clause 2.1 operates as a primary obligation or as a secondary/compensatory/penal provision is a question of construction requiring the clause text (which is available but must be read in full context), the parties’ bargaining matrix and commercial purpose. Application of the modern penalty test (Cavendish / ParkingEye) therefore requires further factual material about the commercial consequences and the parties’ purpose. (Document G — Clause 2.1 quote; Defence ¶6.)\n\nHow the present record affects the parties’ pleaded positions (neutral synthesis):\n- Claimant’s pleaded debt/election route: there is an express minimum in Clause 2.1 (Document G — Clause 2.1). The Claimant has ledger entries and invoices (Documents C, K, T) and contemporaneous minutes/emails that it says show it remained available (Documents L, B, S). These facts give the Claimant a plausible commercial narrative for pursuing payment. But the Claimant has not produced contemporaneous objective evidence that (a) it could validly continue and perform without the Defendant’s cooperation, (b) it incurred reliance costs or forewent other engagements amounting to a \"legitimate commercial interest\", or (c) the Defendant accepted / processed advance invoices per Appendix 2 in a way that converted the claimed amounts into an unconditional debt. On this record the narrow White & Carter preconditions are not shown. (Documents G, C, K, T, L, B, S.)\n- Defendant’s pleaded damages/mitigation/penalty defences: the Defence (P) correctly identifies that, if the minimum was not actually requisitioned by Assignment Note (Document G — Clause 2.2) and if the Claimant did not prove contemporaneous availability/irrecoverable reliance costs, the appropriate remedy is plausibly damages subject to mitigation. The Defence’s penalty contention (Defence ¶6) is a live construction point that cannot be resolved without the fuller clause/context evidence. (Document P — Defence ¶5–6; Document G — Clause 2.2, Appendix 2.)\n\nNet practical recommendation (what this means for case conduct now):\n- Maintain the Claimant’s debt/election argument as a preserved, contingent ground but focus immediate case strategy on the more supportable damages route, while preparing to run the election route only if the Claimant can adduce the specific missing documentary evidence set out below. Do not treat the Claimant’s pleaded entitlement to recover the full contractual price as an established immediate debt based on the current bundle.\n\nEvidence that, if produced, would materially shift the balance toward the debt/election route (each item will be decisive in context):\n- Assignment Notes actually issued (Document G — Clause 2.2): whether Assignment Notes were issued that called off the 500 days or specific days. (Not specified in bundle.)\n- Appendix 2 / PO course of dealing (Document G — Appendix 2): contemporaneous POs/acknowledgements showing yearly‑in‑advance invoices were issued, accepted and processed per the Appendix rather than disputed. (Not specified.)\n- Monthly reporting / timesheets / payroll (Document G — Clause 3.8; Document C): the monthly excel reports and timesheets required by Clause 3.8 showing days \"purchased\", \"used\" and \"remaining\" together with payroll records showing consultants were paid or held on during the disputed period (Not specified in present bundle).\n- Contemporaneous reliance evidence (Document S, C): records that the Claimant turned down alternative work, incurred payroll/commitment costs, or otherwise incurred loss in relying on the minimum (Not specified).\n- Any contemporaneous acceptance or acquiescence by the Defendant to the Claimant’s invoicing (remittance advices, payment ledger entries, or emails acknowledging the invoices or the Appendix 2 workflow) (Not specified).\n- Any contemporaneous repudiatory conduct or explicit rejection/termination by the Defendant that would allow the Claimant to elect to perform and sue for the price (Not specified).\n\nIf those items are produced and show that (i) assignment/P O mechanics were satisfied or waived, (ii) the Claimant actually incurred reliance/unrealisable commitments, and (iii) the Defendant did not treat the invoices as disputed or conditional, the debt/election route under White & Carter would become significantly more tenable. Conversely, evidence that consultants were re‑deployed, offers were accepted elsewhere, POs were not issued or invoices were rejected would reinforce the damages + mitigation characterisation.\n\nChange from earlier recommendation: earlier I advised caution and said Clause 2.1 was Not specified. That was corrected by later material showing Clause 2.1 in Document G; the present recommendation preserves the earlier cautious legal view (damages is the safer immediate route) but corrects the record by quoting Clause 2.1 verbatim (Document G — Clause 2.1 quote). Having the clause available improves the analysis of contractual structure but does not alter the overall practical conclusion without the additional operational documents listed above.\n\nNeutral closing note: the debt/election strategy remains possible in principle but is legally narrow. On the current documents the Claimant has an express minimum contractual clause (Document G — Clause 2.1) and internal accounting/invoices (Documents C, K, T) that support a commercial claim for unpaid minimum days. However, because Clause 2.1 is qualified by \"based on project requirement\" and because the contract requires Assignment Notes and contemplates assignment‑level agreement on rates (Document G — Clauses 2.1–2.3), and because the Claimant has not produced objective contemporaneous evidence of the narrow White & Carter prerequisites (Not specified), the safer, immediate characterisation is damages subject to mitigation and proof of availability. The penalty point remains a live constructional defence that requires further factual context to resolve.\n",

This preserves the prior working conclusion and refines it in light of the Framework Agreement text now in the bundle.\n\nWhy I reach that conclusion (document‑based synthesis):\n1) Primary contract text (treated as controlling):\n   - Document: G - FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES.md — Clause 2.1 (Minimum Purchase Commitment): \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\" (Document G — Clause 2.1 quote)\n   - Document: G — Clause 2.2 (Requisition Process): \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" (Document G — Clause 2.2 quote)\n   - Document: G — Clause 2.3 (Fees and Rates): \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes for each change request...\" (Document G — Clause 2.3 quote)\n   - Document: G — Clause 2.4 (Payment Terms): \"Payment of the fees shall be made within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice from the Supplier.\" (Document G — Clause 2.4 quote)\n   - Document: G — Clause 3.8 (Reporting): \"Supplier is obliged to provide concise accounts of resources used on a monthly basis as an excel document which shows work priorities, days used, days remaining and days purchased.\" (Document G — Clause 3.8 quote)\n   - Document: G — Appendix 2 (PO/Invoicing Workflow): \"The Customer will raise a PO on Fujitsu for the full amount for the services including the paying agent fee.  Fujitsu will raise a PO upon the Supplier for the full service charges.  Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance.  The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (Document G — Appendix 2 quote)\n\n   Analysis: Clause 2.1 does create a numerical minimum, but it is qualified by the words \"based on project requirement\" and sits in a contractual structure that expressly contemplates call‑offs by Assignment Note (Clause 2.2), assignment‑level rate/acceptance (Clause 2.3) and invoicing/PO mechanics through Fujitsu (Appendix 2). On the documentary face of the contract those features point to a call‑off operational model rather than an unconditional, self‑executing right to immediate payment for days not requisitioned.\n\n2) Evidence the Claimant relies on to support a debt/election claim (supportive but not dispositive):\n   - Document: C - E-Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.xlsx (Summary.csv) — spreadsheet expressly used \"to calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices\" and showing Annual_Minimum_Days and Days_Remaining entries (Document C — quotes). This shows how the Claimant quantified shortfalls.\n   - Document: K - Invoice (disputed 1).md — Invoice dated 9 May 2011 described as \"Contract Reconciliation – Year 2 … Charge for the balance of minimum purchased consultancy days not utilized by the Authority\" (Document K).\n   - Document: T - Invoice (disputed 2).md — Invoice dated 25 Oct 2011 (Document T).\n   - Document: L - Minutes of Meeting.md (17 Dec 2010) — minutes stating the Authority requested the supplier \"continue providing services until advised otherwise\" and to \"maintain current resource availability\" (Document L — quote).\n   - Document: B - Email - 15 April 2011.md — email stating work was \"suspended\" but \"not an indicator as to what happens next\" (Document B — quote).\n   - Document: S - Witness statement Dawett.md — Claimant witness asserts it \"stood ready, willing and able\" and references monthly reporting (Document S).\n\n   Analysis: these documents support the Claimant’s commercial narrative (that it tracked days, invoiced for a shortfall and that communications show continuing engagement or suspension). However, they are not, by themselves, contemporaneous objective proof that (a) Assignment Notes or POs were issued or waived in a way that converted the shortfall into an unconditional debt, or (b) the Claimant incurred irrecoverable reliance costs (e.g. payroll/turned‑down work) or otherwise had the narrow \"legitimate commercial interest\" required to make an election to treat the contract as debt secure.\n\n3) Legal constraints and live defences (identified in pleadings and bundle):\n   - The Claimant pleads an election to sue for the contract price (Document: O - Statement of Claim.md — Claimant ¶11–14, ¶18). The law in White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor requires narrow prerequisites (ability to perform unilaterally and a legitimate contemporaneous commercial interest). Modern authorities cited in the micro‑verdicts (e.g. MSC v Cottonex) limit the election where legitimate interest/unilateral performability are not demonstrated.\n   - The Defence (Document: P - Statement of Defence.md — Defence ¶5–6) says the correct remedy is damages (with duty to mitigate and strict proof of availability) and raises a penalty defence: if Clause 2.1 is construed to require unconditional payment for unused days, it may be an unenforceable penalty. That constructional/penalty point is live and cannot be resolved on the present papers without further factual material.\n\n4) Missing decisive documentary evidence (Not specified in the bundle) — these are the specific gaps preventing a reliable debt/election finding on the present materials:\n   - Assignment Notes / call‑offs actually issued for 2009–2011 (Document G — Clause 2.2): Not specified.\n   - Full PO / Fujitsu invoicing chain and processing logs (Appendix 2): Customer→Fujitsu POs; Fujitsu→Supplier POs; Fujitsu invoices to Customer; Supplier invoices to Fujitsu; remittance advices and payment ledger entries: Not specified.\n   - Full copies of the disputed invoices (Documents K and T) with transmittal emails and attachments (timesheets, monthly excel reports required by Clause 3.8): Not specified / incomplete.\n   - Monthly reporting spreadsheets/timesheets and payroll records required by Clause 3.8 showing days purchased/used/remaining and demonstrating the supplier actually held staff on payroll or turned down alternative work: Not specified.\n   - Evidence of contemporaneous acceptance/acquiescence by the Defendant (or Fujitsu) to the Claimant’s invoicing (emails acknowledging invoices, remittance advices, ledger entries): Not specified.\n   - Any contemporaneous documents showing the commercial bargaining matrix or negotiations around Clause 2.1 that would bear on penalty construction: Not specified.\n\n   Impact of these gaps: without them the Claimant cannot presently demonstrate the narrow White & Carter prerequisites (unilateral performability and legitimate contemporaneous commercial interest) or that the Appendix 2/PO mechanics were complied with or waived so as to create an immediate debt. Conversely, if produced and favourable, those documents would materially strengthen a debt/election case.\n\n5) Penalty construction point: the Defence’s contention that an unconditional reading of Clause 2.1 could be a penalty (Document P — Defence ¶6; Document G — Clause 2.1 quote) is a question of contractual construction and commercial purpose which cannot be resolved on the present materials. Application of the modern penalty test (Cavendish/ParkingEye) requires factual evidence about the clause’s commercial function and proportionality.\n\nPractical recommendation for case conduct now (neutral):\n- Preserve the Claimant’s debt/election argument as a contingent alternative but proceed primarily on a damages strategy (liability framed as breach causing loss), requiring the Claimant to prove contemporaneous availability and any mitigation failures. Do not treat the Claimant’s invoiced reconciliations as converting the claimed sums into an unassailable immediate debt without the missing operational documents.\n- Urgently seek the specific missing documents listed above; if they show (a) Assignment Notes or equivalent call‑offs, (b) the Appendix 2 PO/invoice chain was processed/accepted, and (c) contemporaneous payroll/timesheet/foregone work proof, then reassess and consider advancing the election/debt route. If those documents are absent or unfavourable, focus on damages quantification and mitigation evidence.\n\nCitations (selected, document‑specific):\n- Document G - FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES.md — Clause 2.1: \"The Authority hereby undertakes to purchase minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement, additional days will be required once the purchased days have been exhausted.\" (Document G — Clause 2.1 quote)\n- Document G — Clause 2.2: \"The Authority shall issue an Assignment Note to requisition Services from the Supplier.\" (Document G — Clause 2.2 quote)\n- Document G — Appendix 2: \"Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (Document G — Appendix 2 quote)\n- Document C - E-Nik_Monthly_Days_Used_Remaining_with_Summary.xlsx — spreadsheet used to \"calculate unpaid minimum‑usage invoices\" (Document C — quote)\n- Document K - Invoice (disputed 1).md (9 May 2011) and Document T - Invoice (disputed 2).md (25 Oct 2011) — supplier reconciliation invoices claiming the shortfall (Documents K, T).\n- Document L - Minutes of Meeting.md (17 Dec 2010) — instruction to \"continue providing services until advised otherwise\" (Document L — quote)\n- Document B - Email - 15 April 2011.md — \"suspend the current work… not an indicator as to what happens next\" (Document B — quote)\n- Document S - Witness statement Dawett.md — claimant asserts it \"stood ready, willing and able\" (Document S — witness assertions)\n- Document P - Statement of Defence.md — Defence ¶5–6: pleads damages/mitigation and raises penalty argument (Document P — Defence ¶5–6)\n\nOverall confidence statement: the present documentary material does not permit a >60% confident determination that the Claimant is entitled to recover the contractual price as an immediate debt under White & Carter. The evidence points more securely to a damages claim subject to mitigation on the present record. If the missing documents listed above are produced and are favourable to the Claimant, the analysis should be revisited promptly.",
          "suggestion": "Very important further evidence and research required (without these the conclusion cannot be reached with >60% confidence):\n\nDocuments to obtain (priority order):\n1) All Assignment Notes / call‑offs for the relevant period (2009–2011) (Document G — Clause 2.2). These are potentially dispositive to show days were formally requisitioned. (Not specified.)\n2) Full PO / Fujitsu invoicing chain and processing logs described in Appendix 2 (Document G — Appendix 2): Customer→Fujitsu POs; Fujitsu→Supplier POs; Fujitsu invoices to Customer; Supplier invoices to Fujitsu; remittance advices; payment ledger entries. These show whether yearly‑in‑advance invoicing was accepted/processed in practice. (Not specified.)\n3) Full copies of Invoices K (9 May 2011) and T (25 Oct 2011) with transmittal emails and all attachments (timesheets, monthly excel reports required by Clause 3.8). (Partial documents present; originals and attachments Not specified.)\n4) Monthly reporting spreadsheets/timesheets and payroll records required by Clause 3.8 (Document G — Clause 3.8) showing days purchased/used/remaining and proof consultants were held on payroll or offers declined. These are required to establish the \"legitimate commercial interest\" and inability to mitigate. (Not specified.)\n5) Any contemporaneous emails/acknowledgements from the Defendant or Fujitsu accepting, disputing or processing the invoices (remittance advices, ledger entries). (Not specified.)\n6) Any side‑letters, amendments, negotiation drafts or evidence showing the commercial bargaining surrounding Clause 2.1 (to assist penalty construction). (Not specified.)\n7) Witness statements from key individuals (e.g. author of Document B and minute attendees in Document L, payroll/operations staff) to provide contemporaneous factual detail if documentary records are missing.\n\nCase‑law / legal research (very important):\n- White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413 — elements and limits for election to claim the contract price.\n- MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA v Cottonex Anstalt (and subsequent authorities) — modern treatment/limits on the White & Carter election and the \"legitimate commercial interest\" requirement.\n- Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi; ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis [2015] UKSC 67 — modern penalty doctrine (to test the Defence’s penalty argument about Clause 2.1).\n- Authorities on \"minimum purchase\"/\"take or pay\" clauses, course of dealing converting invoices into debts, and on mitigation/proof of availability in service/professional resource contexts.\n\nWhy this is essential: the contract contains an express minimum (Clause 2.1) but conditioned and embedded in call‑off and PO mechanics (Clauses 2.2–2.4; Appendix 2). The narrow legal prerequisites for a White & Carter election (unilateral performability and legitimate contemporaneous commercial interest) must be proved by contemporaneous operational and financial documents (Assignment Notes, POs, timesheets, payroll, remittances). The penalty construction requires evidence of commercial purpose and proportionality. Without the documents above and targeted case law application, the debt/election route cannot be sustained with >60% confidence.",

      "recommendation": "Micro‑verdict (provisional): On the materials supplied, the Claimant’s factual case that the contractual daily rate was intended to be exclusive of VAT is better supported by the parties’ course of dealing. The Claimant pleads and produced earlier invoices rendered with VAT that were paid (Claimant ¶16–17; Documents I, J, U). That consistent treatment is direct evidence that, in practice, VAT was billed on top of the headline daily rate. The Defendant relies on the written contract and Clause 3.7 (VAT compliance) to argue the price is VAT‑inclusive and cites Lancaster v Bird; it also asserts the disputed invoices were invalid because they added VAT and claimed days not worked (Defence ¶7–8). The decisive legal test is contract‑first: clear contractual wording in Clauses 2.3/2.4/3.7 that shows prices are VAT‑inclusive would defeat the Claimant’s course‑of‑dealing evidence; if the clauses are ambiguous, the consistent paid VAT invoices are admissible to clarify the parties’ intention and support the Claimant.

Reasoning (based only on the supplied material):\n\n1) Missing dispositive texts and documents prevent a final construction. The exact wording of Clause 2.3 (daily rate), Clause 2.4 (invoice/payment timing) and Clause 3.7 (VAT) is Not specified; the contested invoices (Documents K, T) and the earlier invoices relied on for course of dealing (Documents I, J) and payment records are Not specified. Interpretation must begin with the contract text read in its matrix, so this evidential gap is decisive (Claimant ¶6; Defence ¶1; Documents I, J, K, T, U Not specified).\n\n2) Applicable interpretive principles. The tribunal should construe the words in their documentary, factual and commercial context and give primary weight to clear contractual language, but where wording is ambiguous contemporaneous commercial practice (course of dealing) is material. See Arnold v Britton [2012] EWHC 3451 (Ch) (03/12/2012): \"The answer to such a question does not simply depend upon the words used in that provision: it is also dependent on the other provisions of the contract, on commercial common sense, and on the surrounding circumstances (or the matrix of facts) at the time the contract was made.\" Also bear in mind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd v Disclosure and Barring Service [2024] EWHC 1185 (TCC) (17/05/2024): the court \"construes the relevant words of a contract in their documentary, factual and commercial context...\" (Claimant ¶16-17; Defence ¶7-8).\n\n3) How the supplied factual positions map to those principles:\n- Claimant’s asserted evidence: the Claimant says the daily rate was quoted exclusive of VAT and relies on course of dealing (earlier invoices showing VAT that were paid) and an accountant’s statement that rates were quoted exclusive of VAT (Claimant ¶16-17; Documents I, J, U). If the contract wording is ambiguous, proven consistent prior invoicing and payment without protest would be a strong interpretive indicator in favour of VAT being payable on top.\n- Defendant’s asserted evidence: the Defendant contends the price is VAT inclusive because Clause 2.3 omits \"plus VAT\" and Clause 3.7 requires the supplier to \"deal with VAT within the price\"; the Defendant also disputes invoice validity (alleging incorrect VAT additions and claims for days not worked), so says the Clause 2.4 30‑day clock never began (Defence ¶7-8). If the operative clauses are clear that the price includes VAT, that express wording will control and defeat any course of dealing argument.\n\n4) Invoice validity/statutory interest: whether statutory interest and fixed compensation under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 are payable depends on (a) whether the invoices satisfied any contractual definition of a \"valid invoice\" in Clause 2.4 (text Not specified) and (b) the factual question whether the invoiced amounts correspond to services actually performed. The Defence allegation that days were invoiced but not worked is a discrete factual dispute the Defendant must prove; absent the invoice documents, timesheets, remittance advices or contemporaneous protest correspondence this cannot be resolved from the summary positions alone (Defence ¶7-8; Claimant ¶18).\n\n5) Net, directional inference (not a finding): absent the operative clause texts, if Documents I and J objectively show repeated VAT‑on‑top invoices accepted and paid without contemporaneous protest, and if Clause 2.3 is ambiguous, the evidential balance would tilt toward the Claimant. Conversely, clear, unambiguous contractual wording that the price is VAT‑inclusive (or requires the supplier to \"deal with VAT within the price\") will favour the Defendant. On invoice validity and the 30‑day trigger the issue is fact‑specific and requires document‑level proof.\n\nAuthoritative references cited in this micro‑verdict (full references):\n- Arnold v Britton [2012] EWHC 3451 (Ch) (03 December 2012).\n- Tata Consultancy Services Limited v Disclosure and Barring Service [2024] EWHC 1185 (TCC) (17 May 2024).\n\nNote: the Defendant cites Lancaster v Bird; no full citation or text for that authority was supplied in the materials (Lancaster v Bird — full reference Not specified).",

(Defence §7‑8.)\n\nMicro‑verdict synthesis (neutral):\n- I cannot reach a definitive (>60%) finding on either: (a) whether the daily rate is VAT‑exclusive or VAT‑inclusive; or (b) whether the disputed invoices were “valid invoices” that started the Clause 2.4 30‑day payment clock and thereby triggered statutory interest. This outcome preserves and integrates all prior micro‑verdicts.\n\nWhy a definitive finding cannot be made on the current record (document‑based explanation):\n1) Contract text is primary but missing: The contract clauses that are dispositive are named but their verbatim text is Not specified. In particular: Clause 2.3 (daily rate) — text Not specified; Clause 2.4 (invoicing/payment timing and any contractual definition of a “valid invoice”) — text Not specified; Clause 3.7 (VAT) — text Not specified. Under the contract‑priority rule the tribunal must read the exact clause wording first. (Document: G — FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT: Clauses 2.3, 2.4, 3.7 — Not specified.)\n\n2) Core transactional documents are missing or not produced for inspection: The invoicing evidence relied on for course of dealing and for the contested invoices is Not specified in the supplied bundle: Documents I and J (earlier invoices), Documents K and T (disputed invoices), and the payment ledger/remittance evidence (Document M / other payment records) are Not specified. The accountant email (Document U) is referenced but its text is Not specified. Without these primary documents it is impossible to verify whether VAT was separately shown, whether VAT was actually paid, or whether invoices complied with any contractual “valid invoice” requirements.\n\n3) There are two distinct enquiries that must be answered and which are presently under‑evidenced:\n   - Contractual construction: whether express contract language (if present) makes the price VAT‑inclusive or VAT‑exclusive. The Defence’s reported reading attributes to Clause 3.7 the phrase that the Supplier must “deal with VAT within the price” (Defence §7‑8). That particular quoted phrase is taken from the Defence pleading and the actual clause text remains Not specified; if that phrase appears verbatim in Clause 3.7 it would be highly material. Conversely, if Clause 2.3 or the pricing schedule contains express words such as “exclusive of VAT” or “plus VAT” that would be decisive for the Claimant. (Document: G — Clauses 2.3/3.7 — text Not specified.)\n   - Invoice validity / performance: whether invoices constitute a “valid invoice” under Clause 2.4 and whether the invoiced sums correspond to work actually performed. The Defence alleges incorrect VAT additions and billing for days not worked (Defence §7‑8). Those are discrete factual matters requiring timesheets, delivery/acceptance evidence, remittance advices, and contemporaneous dispute communications; those documents are Not specified in the bundle.\n\n4) Role of course of dealing (evidential tie‑breaker): The Claimant’s asserted course of dealing (earlier VAT invoices I/J paid without protest and the accountant email U stating rates were quoted exclusive of VAT) would be a strong interpretive indicator in the event the written contract is ambiguous. But the invoices (I, J) and payment evidence (ledger M / remittances) are Not specified for review, so their content and weight cannot be assessed. (Documents I, J, M, U — Not specified.)\n\n5) Directional inferences (purely evidential, not findings):\n   - If, on production, Clauses 2.3/3.7 are ambiguous and Documents I/J plus ledger M show a consistent practice of separate VAT lines that were paid without contemporaneous protest, the evidential balance would tilt toward the Claimant that VAT was payable on top and that properly‑formed invoices were issued. (Claimant §16‑18; Documents I, J, U — Not specified.)\n   - If, conversely, the actual wording of Clause 2.3 or Clause 3.7 expressly makes the price VAT‑inclusive (e.g. by saying the Supplier shall “deal with VAT within the price”), that express contractual language will control and favour the Defendant irrespective of some prior invoicing practice. (Defence §7‑8; actual clause text Not specified.)\n   - On invoice validity and the 30‑day trigger, the outcome turns on (a) whether Clause 2.4 defines “valid invoice” and sets conditions precedent for payment (text Not specified), and (b) whether timesheets / acceptance records corroborate the invoiced days. The Defence must prove its factual allegation of non‑performance if it relies on it.\n\nPractical, document‑based conclusion: The record supplied is inadequate to resolve the VAT‑construction or the invoice‑validity/30‑day clock with the confidence required for a final finding. The tribunal should apply the contract‑first interpretive approach once the verbatim clauses and the primary transactional documents are produced.\n\nSpecific documentary references used in the synthesis (from materials provided):\n- G - FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF ICT CONSULTANCY SERVICES — Clauses 2.3, 2.4, 3.7 named but exact wording Not specified.\n- I - Invoice (1) (2009) — referenced as an earlier VAT invoice (Not specified in bundle).\n- J - Invoice (2) (2011) — referenced as an earlier VAT invoice (Not specified in bundle).\n- K - Invoice (disputed 1) (9 May 2011) — disputed invoice (Not specified in bundle).\n- T - Invoice (disputed 2) (25 Oct 2011) — disputed invoice (Not specified in bundle).\n- M - Payment_Ledger_Minimum_COMMITMENT_E‑Nik_Style — ledger referenced but Not specified.\n- U - Email - Accountant - late 2012 — referenced but Not specified (alleged phrase: E‑NIK “always quoted rates exclusive of VAT”).\n- Claimant pleadings: Claimant §6, §16‑18 (summary assertions about clause existence, course of dealing and statutory interest claims).\n- Defence pleadings: Defence §1, §7‑8 (asserting clause readings, that Clause 2.3 omits “plus VAT” and that Clause 3.7 requires the Supplier to “deal with VAT within the price”; alleging invoice invalidity and days not worked).\n\nRecommendation (actionable next procedural step to enable a final finding):\n- Obtain and produce verbatim copies (PDFs or image files) of the Framework Agreement (Document G) showing Clauses 2.3, 2.4 and 3.7, the Definitions/price definitions, Appendix 1 (pricing) and Appendix 2 (invoicing/PO procedure). Where a party relies on a clause, the tribunal must be shown the exact clause wording. Currently: Not specified.\n- Obtain full images of the relevant invoices: Documents I, J (earlier invoices said to show VAT and to have been paid) and Documents K, T (the disputed invoices). Each invoice should show date, invoice number, unit price wording (e.g. whether it says “£X per day” or “£X per day plus VAT”), whether a separate VAT line appears, VAT registration number, and any PO or contract reference.\n- Produce remittance advices, payment ledger (M) extracts, and bank statements that link payments to invoice numbers and show whether VAT amounts were paid and whether any payments carried contemporaneous protest annotations.\n- Produce timesheets, attendance/job sheets, delivery/acceptance records or other contemporaneous records showing whether the days invoiced were worked.\n- Produce the accountant’s email (U) verbatim and any related correspondence it references.\n- Obtain any contemporaneous emails/notes where the Defendant objected to VAT on earlier invoices, or where the Defendant accepted VAT charges by paying without protest.\n\nQuantification/decision readiness threshold: None of the above documents are currently supplied in verbatim form. Until they are produced, the tribunal cannot reliably apply the cited interpretive authorities (Arnold v Britton; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd v DBS) nor assess the factual dispute about performance and invoice validity.\n\nNeutral closing note: The above preserves the earlier micro‑verdicts and integrates their evidential checklist. The tribunal should treat the contract wording as primary; course of dealing and payment practice will be admissible and weighty only if the written words are ambiguous and the documentary practice is clear. The Defence’s cited phrase that Clause 3.7 requires the Supplier to “deal with VAT within the price” is recorded from the Defence pleading (Defence §7‑8) but the actual clause text remains Not specified and must be produced before it can be quoted as contractual language.",

(Documents K, T and Appendix 2.)\n- Did the Defendant ever contemporaneously object to VAT being charged on specific invoices? (Emails/correspondence.)\n- Do timesheets and acceptance records support the days billed in K/T? If not, what contemporaneous evidence exists showing non‑performance? (Timesheets/acceptance records.)\n\nD. Tactical research/next steps once documents produced:\n- If the contract wording is clear that the price is VAT‑inclusive, prepare arguments showing why course of dealing cannot override clear contract language.\n- If the contract wording is ambiguous, assemble the chronology and course‑of‑dealing bundle (I, J, ledger, remittances, accountant email U) showing consistent invoicing practice and any waiver/acceptance conduct.\n- If invoices are found to be “invalid” under Clause 2.4 or lacking required supporting documents, assess whether any contemporaneous partial payments or protests amount to acceptance/waiver.\n\nWithout the documents listed in A and the case law in B, the tribunal cannot reach >60% confidence on the VAT construction or whether Clause 2.4’s 30‑day clock was triggered.",

          "recommendation": "Summary conclusion (neutral)\n- Issue: whether the contractual daily rate was intended to be exclusive of VAT (so VAT payable on top) and whether the Claimant’s invoiced sums were “valid invoices” under Clause 2.4 such that the contractual 30‑day payment clock and statutory interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 were triggered. \n- Outcome on the provided materials: cannot reach a definitive (>60%) finding for either question. The contract text is the primary source and the key clauses must be read verbatim; on the present record the contract extracts and the primary transactional documents are either silent on decisive points or not produced in full for verification. This preserves and expands the prior recommendation.\n\nWhat the produced documents (as supplied in the bundle) actually show (documented facts and verbatim contractual quotes relied on):\n- Framework Agreement (Document: G) — verbatim quoted clauses present in the bundle:\n  - Clause 2.3 (Fees and Rates): \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day but subject to mutually agreed assignment notes for each change request. This rate may be revised upward at the time of issue of an Assignment Note to reflect the complexity of the Services requisitioned or the level of skill required for the provision of the Services.\" (G Quote 1). \n  - Clause 2.4 (Payment Terms): \"Payment of the fees shall be made within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice from the Supplier.\" (G Quote 2).\n  - Clause 3.7 (Legal Compliance (VAT/Corporate)): \"To comply with all the requirements of VAT legislation and the Companies Act.\" (G Quote 3).\n  - Appendix 2 (invoicing flow): \"The Customer will raise a PO on Fujitsu for the full amount for the services including the paying agent fee. Fujitsu will raise a PO upon the Supplier for the full service charges. Fujitsu will raise an invoice upon the Customer yearly in advance. The Supplier will raise an invoice upon Fujitsu yearly in advance.\" (G Quote 7).\n- Earlier invoices and invoicing practice (transactional evidence in the bundle):\n  - Document I (Invoice EN‑09‑006, 30 Sept 2009) shows a daily rate of £850 and on its face itemises Net and VAT lines: \"Net £40,800.00; VAT @15% £6,120.00; Total £46,920.00\" and contains \"Payment due within 30 days of invoice date\" (Invoice Quotes 4–6) and a supplier VAT registration number is shown (Invoice Quote 1). (Document: I)\n  - Document J (Invoice dated 31 Mar 2011) records: \"Total Days Delivered: 125 Days Daily Rate: £850.00\" and itemises \"Net Amount: £106,250.00 VAT @ 20%: £21,250.00 Total Due: £127,500.00\" and states \"Payment due within 30 days of invoice date.\" (J Quotes 5, 7–9). (Document: J)\n  - Document K (disputed invoice 9 May 2011) invoices the shortfall and separately shows VAT: \"VAT @ 20%: £84,320.00\" and states \"Payment due within 30 days of invoice date.\" (K Quotes 6–8). (Document: K)\n  - Document T (disputed invoice EN‑11‑052, 25 Oct 2011) shows a separate VAT line: \"VAT @ 20%: £42,500.00\", a VAT registration number and payment terms \"Payment due within 30 days of invoice date.\" (T Quotes 1, 7–10). (Document: T)\n- Payment ledger and payment practice (Document M): ledger shows a dedicated VAT column and records VAT amounts for invoices including earlier invoices (INV‑2009‑001, INV‑2011‑005, INV‑2011‑006) as paid; two large disputed invoices (INV‑2011‑007 and INV‑2011‑008) are recorded as UNPAID (M Quotes 3–8). (Document: M)\n- Accountant’s contemporaneous/retrospective note (Document U): an accountant’s email is recorded in the bundle as stating that \"E‑Nik Ltd always quoted the chargeable rate exclusive of VAT\" (Document: U Quote 1–2). (Document: U)\n\nWhy the record is presently inconclusive (document‑based analysis)\n1) Contract‑first rule and ambiguity: Clause 2.3 fixes the £850/day figure but does not say \"plus VAT\" in the quoted wording. Clause 3.7, as quoted, is short and procedural: \"To comply with all the requirements of VAT legislation and the Companies Act.\" (G Quotes 1 & 3). Neither of those verbatim extracts expressly says the rate is \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" of VAT. Clause 2.4 conditions payment on \"a valid invoice\" (G Quote 2) but the Framework Agreement extract provided does not itself define \"valid invoice\". Because the contract is the primary source, the tribunal must apply the exact clause texts; the present clauses (as quoted) are silent or ambiguous on the dispositive point of VAT allocation.\n\n2) Course of dealing vs express wording: the Claimant’s documentary evidence (Documents I and J and ledger M) shows that the supplier historically presented invoices with separate VAT lines and that at least some earlier invoices were paid with VAT itemised. The Claimant also relies on Document U (accountant email) asserting the rate was quoted exclusive of VAT. Those items — if verified by the full invoice images and remittance traces — would be a strong interpretive indicator if the written words are ambiguous. However, the precise effect of that course of dealing depends on the contract wording: if the contract contains express language (not present in the supplied G quotes) that makes the price VAT‑inclusive (Defendant says Clause 3.7 requires the Supplier to \"deal with VAT within the price\" — that phrase appears in Defence pleading but is not quoted from the contract in the bundle), the express contract will control.\n\n3) \"Valid invoice\" condition and factual disputes on performance: Clause 2.4 says payment is due within 30 days \"of the date of a valid invoice from the Supplier.\" (G Quote 2). The bundle does not supply a contractual definition of \"valid invoice\" in the text produced; Appendix 2 sets an invoicing flow (G Quote 7) but does not itself define the phrase. Whether K/T were \"valid invoices\" therefore depends on (a) whether Clause 2.4/Appendix 2 or an Assignment Note/PO prescribes required invoice fields and attachments (PO numbers, timesheets, tax‑invoice wording), and (b) whether the invoiced days were actually performed. The Defence pleads (Defence §7–8) that some invoices added VAT incorrectly and included days not worked; those are factual matters needing timesheets/acceptance records and remittance/bank evidence to resolve. Some invoices in the bundle (K, T) show no PO or timesheet attachment on their face; whether that omission renders them invalid is a contractual question dependent on the missing precise clause/appendix wording.\n\n4) Documentary gaps and evidential tipping points: the present bundle contains invoice extracts and ledger entries that point in the Claimant’s favour on practice, but the contract wording could be dispositive in the Defendant’s favour if it contains explicit VAT‑inclusive language. The Defence’s pleaded phrase that Clause 3.7 requires the Supplier to \"deal with VAT within the price\" appears to come from the Defence pleading (Defence §7–8) rather than being produced as the contract text in the bundle. Until the tribunal can read the actual Clause 3.7 language (if such wording exists), that assertion cannot be used as a contractual quote.\n\nPractical recommendation — documents to produce (critical, contract‑first)\n(These follow and refine the prior iteration's list. Each item is essential to reach a >60% confident finding.)\n1) Framework Agreement (Document G) — produce the executed/signed full agreement (PDF/image) showing the exact, verbatim text of:\n   - Clause 2.3 (Fees and Rates) — quote: \"The Authority shall pay the Supplier fees at the rate of not less than £850 per day ...\" (G Quote 1).\n   - Clause 2.4 (Payment Terms) — quote: \"Payment of the fees shall be made within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice from the Supplier.\" (G Quote 2).\n   - Clause 3.7 (Legal Compliance (VAT/Corporate)) — quote: \"To comply with all the requirements of VAT legislation and the Companies Act.\" (G Quote 3).\n   - All Definitions (Price, VAT, Invoice, Valid Invoice), Appendix 1 (pricing schedule) and Appendix 2 (invoicing/PO mechanics) in full. If the Defence relies on specific language such as that the Supplier must \"deal with VAT within the price,\" produce the clause text verbatim so it can be quoted and applied.\n2) Full, high‑resolution images/PDFs of the relevant invoices:\n   - Document I (EN‑09‑006) — show the Net/VAT/Total arithmetic and any VAT registration number and any attachments. (I Quote: \"Net £40,800.00; VAT @15% £6,120.00; Total £46,920.00\"; \"Payment due within 30 days of invoice date\").\n   - Document J (31 Mar 2011) — show \"Total Days Delivered: 125 Days Daily Rate: £850.00\" and VAT arithmetic (J Quote: \"Net Amount: £106,250.00 VAT @ 20%: £21,250.00 Total Due: £127,500.00\") and payment terms.\n   - Documents K and T (disputed invoices) — show whether VAT is separately itemised (K Quote: \"VAT @ 20%: £84,320.00\"; T Quote: \"VAT @ 20%: £42,500.00\"), whether PO references or timesheet attachments are present, and full invoice headers.\n3) Payment evidence linking payments to invoice numbers (Document M and bank traces) and any remittance advices: produce the payment ledger extracts showing which invoices were paid and whether VAT amounts were paid, and any contemporaneous payment annotations (e.g. \"paid without prejudice\", \"under protest\"). (M Quote: ledger shows dedicated VAT column and that some invoices were paid; INV‑2011‑007 / INV‑2011‑008 recorded UNPAID.)\n4) Performance records: timesheets, monthly resource spreadsheets (Document C), assignment notes, acceptance records or sign‑offs that show whether the days invoiced were actually worked and accepted. This is necessary to assess the Defence’s factual allegation that days in K/T were not worked. (C Quotes: spreadsheet records days used/remaining but is silent on VAT.)\n5) Contemporaneous correspondence and the accountant’s email: produce Document U (the accountant’s email) verbatim and any contemporaneous emails/notes where the Defendant expressly accepted or objected to VAT on any invoice. (Document U Quote: accountant email asserting \"E‑Nik Ltd always quoted the chargeable rate exclusive of VAT\").\n6) Any Assignment Notes, Purchase Orders, Fujitsu POs or operational invoicing templates (Appendix 2 / N) that were relied on by the parties when issuing or processing invoices.\n\nHow the tribunal should apply the evidence once produced (brief guidance)\n- Read the exact wording of Clauses 2.3, 2.4 and 3.7 first. If any of those clauses unambiguously state that the price is VAT‑inclusive (for example, if the actual Clause 3.7 contains express wording that the Supplier must \"deal with VAT within the price\" or Clause 2.3/Appendix 1 expressly states the daily rate is \"inclusive of VAT\"), that express term will control and course of dealing will not override it.\n- If the contract wording is genuinely ambiguous on VAT, the tribunal should weigh the contemporaneous course of dealing: consistent prior invoices (I, J) showing separate VAT lines that were paid without contemporaneous protest (ledger M and remittances) will be strong evidence that parties treated the price as VAT‑exclusive in practice (supporting the Claimant). The accountant’s contemporaneous email (U) is corroborative but is secondary to contemporaneous invoices/payments.\n- On Clause 2.4 and statutory interest: if Clause 2.4 or Appendix 2 defines a contractual \"valid invoice\" by reference to certain fields or attachments (PO, timesheet, tax‑invoice label), and the disputed invoices K/T do not comply with those requirements or the timesheets do not support the billed days, then the 30‑day clock may not have begun for those invoices. If, however, the disputed invoices comply with the contractually required form and the work was performed/accepted, the clock runs from the invoice date per Clause 2.4 (G Quote 2) and statutory interest is potentially triggered.\n\nConcluding practical note (neutral):\n- On the present record (the bundle as supplied), the contract extracts quoted are silent or ambiguous on VAT allocation and the primary transactional documents needed to prove course of dealing and invoice validity are not all produced in verbatim/full image form. Therefore the tribunal should require the specific documents listed above and then apply the contract‑first interpretive approach. Until those materials are produced and tested, the tribunal cannot reach a reasoned final determination with confidence.\n",
          "suggestion": "Essential further case‑law and documentary research to reach a final finding (these are necessary — without them you cannot reach >60% certainty):\n1) Documentary production (urgent and essential): obtain the verbatim/executed FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT (Document G) including Clauses 2.3, 2.4, 3.7, Definitions and Appendices 1 & 2; full images/PDFs of invoices I, J, K, T; payment ledger M with remittance/bank traces; timesheets/monthly resource spreadsheets (Document C) and acceptance records; and Document U (accountant email) in full. These are indispensable — the contract clauses and primary invoices/payments are dispositive.\n2) Case‑law and statutory research (essential):\n   - Read Lancaster v Bird (authority cited by the Defence) in full to test the Defence’s reliance on it for the proposition that omission of \"plus VAT\" implies VAT is included or that an incorrectly‑stated VAT invoice can be invalid. \n   - Review contractual interpretation authorities emphasising the contract‑first approach and course of dealing as an interpretive aid (e.g. Arnold v Britton and subsequent TCC authorities cited by the parties). \n   - Research authorities on what constitutes a \"valid invoice\" for contractual payment clocks and on the operation of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 when invoices are disputed or defective. \n   - Consult HMRC guidance (e.g. VAT Notice and VAT invoice form requirements) and case law on the formal content of VAT invoices.\nRationale: both precise contract wording and the contemporaneous invoice/payment practice are determinative; without the full contract text and the invoice/payment/timesheet images the legal tests from the precedents cannot be applied to the facts with sufficient confidence.",

The Parties\n\n1. The Claimant is an information technology services company.  \n2. The Defendant is a Government department responsible for communities and local government.\n\n### 2\\. The Contract\n\n3. On 1 April 2009, the Claimant and Defendant entered into a contract for the provision of consultancy services (the \"Contract\").  \n4. The Contract was signed on 20 May 2009 by the Claimant (specifically by the husband of Ms. Dawett, a shareholder) and on 21 May 2009 by Mr. Bentley on behalf of the Defendant.  \n5. The Contract was for a fixed term of two and a half years, commencing on 1 April 2009 and expiring on 30 September 2011\\.  \n6. The Contract included the following material terms:  \n   * Minimum Obligation: Under Clause 2.1, the Defendant undertook to \"purchase \\[a\\] minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement\".  \n   * Daily Rate: Under Clause 2.3, the fees were set at a rate of \"not less than £850 per day\".  \n   * Payment Terms: Under Clause 2.4, payment was due \"within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice\".  \n   * Reporting: Under Clause 3.8, the Claimant was required to account for resources monthly, specifically showing \"days remaining and days purchased\".\n\n### 3\\. The Meaning of the Contract\n\n7. The proper construction of Clause 2.1 is that the Defendant was subject to an absolute obligation to purchase and pay for a minimum of 500 days of consultancy services for each year of the Contract.  \n8. Regarding the final six-month period of the Contract (1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011), the annual minimum of 500 days applies on a pro-rata basis, resulting in an obligation to purchase 250 days.  \n9. The Claimant relies on the following distinct points to support this interpretation:  \n   * The \"Minimum\" Wording: The phrase \"based on project requirement\" explains how the minimum figure was calculated but does not make the obligation conditional. To interpret it otherwise would render the word \"minimum\" meaningless.  \n   * The Cancellation Clause: Clause 8.1 required the Defendant to give 12 months' notice to terminate. The Claimant contends it would be commercially pointless to include a 12-month notice period if the Defendant could simply choose to purchase zero days.  \n   * Invoicing Intent: Appendix 2 (inherited from the framework agreement) provided for invoices to be raised \"yearly in advance.\" This proves the parties intended the 500 days to be a guaranteed block purchased up-front.  \n   * Reporting Obligations: Clause 3.8 required the Claimant to report on \"days remaining.\" This implies a fixed \"pot\" of days that was being depleted, which is inconsistent with the idea that days were only purchased on demand.  \n10. This interpretation reflects the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting, as evidenced by an exchange of emails shortly before signing:  \n    * On 12 May 2009, Ms. Dawett (for the Claimant) asked Mr. Bentley to confirm that \"the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year for the duration of the contract\".  \n    * On 15 May 2009, Mr. Bentley (for the Defendant) replied: \"Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik's engagement for work\".\n\n### 4\\. Performance and Breach\n\n11. Throughout the duration of the Contract, the Claimant remained \"ready, willing and able\" to provide the full 500 days of consultancy services per year.  \n12. The Claimant asserts that the contract was never terminated and the Defendant never stated they no longer required the availability of the team. This is evidenced by:  \n    * December 2010: A meeting where the Defendant’s representative (Kate Kedge) requested the Claimant \"continue providing services until advised otherwise\" .  \n    * April 2011: An email from the Defendant (David Main) stating that work was suspended but this was \"not an indicator as to what happens next\".  \n13. Because the Claimant kept the services available, the Defendant is liable for the shortfall as a debt, not damages. The Claimant relies on the principle that they were entitled to keep the contract alive and claim the agreed price (*White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor*).  \n14. The total unpaid sum in issue is £760,920 (inclusive of VAT).  \n15. This sum is comprised of two unpaid invoices rendered by the Claimant for the balance of unused days:  \n    * Invoice dated 9 May 2011 (Year 2 shortfall).  \n    * Invoice dated 25 October 2011 (Final period shortfall).\n\n### 5\\. VAT\n\n16. The Claimant avers that VAT is payable on top of the daily rate of £850.  \n17. The Claimant relies on two arguments:  \n    * Course of Dealing: Throughout the relationship, the Claimant rendered invoices with VAT added to the £850 rate, and the Defendant paid these invoices without protest. This established a custom or implied term.  \n    * Commercial Reality: The £850 rate was a \"blended rate\" for all staff. If VAT were included in that figure, the net rate would be lower than the Claimant’s cheapest staff grade, rendering the contract uneconomic.\n\n### 6\\. Interest\n\n18. The principal sum claimed is a qualifying debt under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998\\.  \n19. The Claimant is entitled to statutory interest and fixed compensation under the Act because the invoices remain unpaid beyond the 30-day period allowed by Clause 2.4.\n\n**AND THE CLAIMANT CLAIMS:**\n\n1. The sum of £760,920 (comprising the principal debt and VAT).  \n2. Statutory interest pursuant to the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998\\.  \n3. Costs.\n\n**STATEMENT OF TRUTH**\n\nI believe that the facts stated in these Particulars of Claim are true.\n\nSigned: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Ms. Dawett Director/Shareholder, E-Nik Ltd Dated: 30 May 2012\n\n",
  "statement_of_defence": "**IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION COMMERCIAL COURT**\n\nClaim No: 2012 Folio 745\n\n**B E T W E E N :**\n\n**E-NIK LTD** (Claimant)\n\n**\\- and \\-**\n\n**DEPARTMENT FOR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT** (Defendant)\n\n---\n\n**DEFENCE**\n\n---\n\n**1\\. ADMISSIONS OF FACT (PARTIES AND CONTRACT)** The Defendant admits the following facts pleaded by the Claimant: (a) The Claimant is an IT services company and the Defendant is a Government Department. (b) The parties entered into a contract dated 1 April 2009 (\"the Contract\"). (c) The Contract contained the specific clauses cited by the Claimant (Clauses 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.7, and 3.8). (d) The Contract term expired on 30 September 2011\\.\n\nExcept as expressly admitted above, the Defendant denies the Claimant’s claim in its entirety.\n\n**2\\. THE DISPUTE OVER THE \"MINIMUM\" 500 DAYS** The Defendant denies that it was absolutely obliged to purchase 500 days of consultancy every year regardless of need. \n\n(a) **The Condition Precedent:** The obligation in Clause 2.1 to purchase 500 days was expressly qualified by the words **\"based on project requirement\"**. \n\n(b) **Meaning:** This phrase means the obligation was conditional. If the Defendant’s specific projects did not require 500 days of work, the Defendant was not contractually bound to purchase them. \n\n(c) **Change in Circumstances:** Following the announcement of the closure of the Government Offices for the Regions (GOR) in 2010, the \"project requirement\" for the Claimant's services ceased or was significantly reduced. Therefore, the obligation to purchase days also ceased.\n\n**3\\. RESPONSE TO PRE-CONTRACTUAL EMAILS** The Claimant relies on an email from Mr. Bentley dated 15 May 2009 to interpret the Contract. The Defendant contends this email is irrelevant because: (a) The critical words **\"based on project requirement\"** were inserted into the final Contract **after** that email was sent. (b) Consequently, the email reflects an earlier, incomplete stage of negotiation and does not reflect the final agreement.\n\n**4\\. THE \"FINAL PERIOD\" (APRIL – SEPT 2011\\)** The Claimant seeks payment for a \"pro-rated\" minimum of 250 days for the final six months of the contract. This is denied because: (a) **\"Per Year\" means Per Year:** Clause 2.1 only specifies a minimum \"per year\". (b) **No Pro-Rating Clause:** Unlike other contracts between these same parties (specifically the *VMware* and *eDesk* agreements), this Contract contains no express term allowing the minimum commitment to be split or pro-rated for a partial year. (c) Therefore, no minimum purchase obligation existed for the final half-year period.\n\n**5\\. INCORRECT LEGAL BASIS (DEBT vs. DAMAGES)** The Claimant is suing for a \"debt\" (money owed for services). The Defendant argues this is legally incorrect. \n\n(a) **Failure to Request:** If the Defendant failed to buy the 500 days (which is denied), that would be a failure to *request* work. The remedy for that is a claim for **damages** (compensation for loss), not a debt. \n\n(b) **Duty to Mitigate:** Because it is a claim for damages, the Claimant was required to find other work for its consultants to reduce its losses. The Claimant is put to strict proof that it tried to find other work. \n\n(c) **Availability:** The Defendant puts the Claimant to strict proof that it actually kept a team of consultants ready and available to work during the entire period of inactivity.\n\n**6\\. PENALTY CLAUSE** Alternatively, if the Court finds that Clause 2.1 forces the Defendant to pay for 500 days of work even if no work was needed or done, the Defendant argues this clause is an unenforceable **penalty**. It imposes a punishment out of proportion to the Claimant’s actual loss.\n\n**7\\. DISPUTE AS TO VAT** The Claimant has added VAT to its invoices. The Defendant denies VAT is payable on top of the fee. \n\n(a) **Inclusive Rate:** The agreed fee in Clause 2.3 is \"£850 per day\". The Contract does not say \"£850 *plus VAT*\". \n\n(b) **Supplier's Duty:** Clause 3.7 states the Supplier must comply with VAT legislation. This implies the Supplier must calculate VAT *within* the £850, not add it on top. \n\n(c) **Legal Precedent:** The Defendant relies on the case of *Lancaster v Bird*, which establishes that if a contract doesn't mention VAT, the price is deemed to include it.\n\n**8\\. INTEREST** The Defendant denies it owes statutory interest on late payments. \n\n(a) **Invalid Invoices:** Under Clause 2.4, payment is due only after a \"valid invoice\" is received. \n\n(b) **The Error:** The Claimant’s invoices were invalid because they incorrectly added VAT and claimed for days not worked. \n\n(c) **Conclusion:** Because the invoices were invalid, the 30-day payment clock never started, and no interest has accrued.\n\n**STATEMENT OF TRUTH**\n\nThe Defendant believes that the facts stated in this Defence are true.\n\nSigned: *Mr. Culver* Head of Procurement, Department for Communities and Local Government\n\n"
