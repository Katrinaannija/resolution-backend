Dear Ms. Dawett,

I am afraid that we will have to suspend the current work that you are carrying out.

However, I should note that the current suspension is not an indicator as to what happens next, and does not prejudice and future decision or action.

Regards,

**David Main** Department for Communities and Local Government
