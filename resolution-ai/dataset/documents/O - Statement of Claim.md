### 1\. The Parties

1. The Claimant is an information technology services company.  
2. The Defendant is a Government department responsible for communities and local government.

### 2\. The Contract

3. On 1 April 2009, the Claimant and Defendant entered into a contract for the provision of consultancy services (the "Contract").  
4. The Contract was signed on 20 May 2009 by the Claimant (specifically by the husband of Ms. Dawett, a shareholder) and on 21 May 2009 by Mr. Bentley on behalf of the Defendant.  
5. The Contract was for a fixed term of two and a half years, commencing on 1 April 2009 and expiring on 30 September 2011\.  
6. The Contract included the following material terms:  
   * Minimum Obligation: Under Clause 2.1, the Defendant undertook to "purchase \[a\] minimum of 500 days of Consultancy from the Supplier per year based on project requirement".  
   * Daily Rate: Under Clause 2.3, the fees were set at a rate of "not less than £850 per day".  
   * Payment Terms: Under Clause 2.4, payment was due "within 30 days of the date of a valid invoice".  
   * Reporting: Under Clause 3.8, the Claimant was required to account for resources monthly, specifically showing "days remaining and days purchased".

### 3\. The Meaning of the Contract

7. The proper construction of Clause 2.1 is that the Defendant was subject to an absolute obligation to purchase and pay for a minimum of 500 days of consultancy services for each year of the Contract.  
8. Regarding the final six-month period of the Contract (1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011), the annual minimum of 500 days applies on a pro-rata basis, resulting in an obligation to purchase 250 days.  
9. The Claimant relies on the following distinct points to support this interpretation:  
   * The "Minimum" Wording: The phrase "based on project requirement" explains how the minimum figure was calculated but does not make the obligation conditional. To interpret it otherwise would render the word "minimum" meaningless.  
   * The Cancellation Clause: Clause 8.1 required the Defendant to give 12 months' notice to terminate. The Claimant contends it would be commercially pointless to include a 12-month notice period if the Defendant could simply choose to purchase zero days.  
   * Invoicing Intent: Appendix 2 (inherited from the framework agreement) provided for invoices to be raised "yearly in advance." This proves the parties intended the 500 days to be a guaranteed block purchased up-front.  
   * Reporting Obligations: Clause 3.8 required the Claimant to report on "days remaining." This implies a fixed "pot" of days that was being depleted, which is inconsistent with the idea that days were only purchased on demand.  
10. This interpretation reflects the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting, as evidenced by an exchange of emails shortly before signing:  
    * On 12 May 2009, Ms. Dawett (for the Claimant) asked Mr. Bentley to confirm that "the minimum 500 days will be purchased per year for the duration of the contract".  
    * On 15 May 2009, Mr. Bentley (for the Defendant) replied: "Yes the 500 days would be purchased at a minimum per year to secure enik's engagement for work".

### 4\. Performance and Breach

11. Throughout the duration of the Contract, the Claimant remained "ready, willing and able" to provide the full 500 days of consultancy services per year.  
12. The Claimant asserts that the contract was never terminated and the Defendant never stated they no longer required the availability of the team. This is evidenced by:  
    * December 2010: A meeting where the Defendant’s representative (Kate Kedge) requested the Claimant "continue providing services until advised otherwise" .  
    * April 2011: An email from the Defendant (David Main) stating that work was suspended but this was "not an indicator as to what happens next".  
13. Because the Claimant kept the services available, the Defendant is liable for the shortfall as a debt, not damages. The Claimant relies on the principle that they were entitled to keep the contract alive and claim the agreed price (*White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor*).  
14. The total unpaid sum in issue is £760,920 (inclusive of VAT).  
15. This sum is comprised of two unpaid invoices rendered by the Claimant for the balance of unused days:  
    * Invoice dated 9 May 2011 (Year 2 shortfall).  
    * Invoice dated 25 October 2011 (Final period shortfall).

### 5\. VAT

16. The Claimant avers that VAT is payable on top of the daily rate of £850.  
17. The Claimant relies on two arguments:  
    * Course of Dealing: Throughout the relationship, the Claimant rendered invoices with VAT added to the £850 rate, and the Defendant paid these invoices without protest. This established a custom or implied term.  
    * Commercial Reality: The £850 rate was a "blended rate" for all staff. If VAT were included in that figure, the net rate would be lower than the Claimant’s cheapest staff grade, rendering the contract uneconomic.

### 6\. Interest

18. The principal sum claimed is a qualifying debt under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998\.  
19. The Claimant is entitled to statutory interest and fixed compensation under the Act because the invoices remain unpaid beyond the 30-day period allowed by Clause 2.4.

**AND THE CLAIMANT CLAIMS:**

1. The sum of £760,920 (comprising the principal debt and VAT).  
2. Statutory interest pursuant to the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998\.  
3. Costs.

**STATEMENT OF TRUTH**

I believe that the facts stated in these Particulars of Claim are true.
