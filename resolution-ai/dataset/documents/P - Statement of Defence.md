**\- and \-**

**DEFENCE**

---

**1\. ADMISSIONS OF FACT (PARTIES AND CONTRACT)** The Defendant admits the following facts pleaded by the Claimant: (a) The Claimant is an IT services company and the Defendant is a Government Department. (b) The parties entered into a contract dated 1 April 2009 ("the Contract"). (c) The Contract contained the specific clauses cited by the Claimant (Clauses 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.7, and 3.8). (d) The Contract term expired on 30 September 2011\.

Except as expressly admitted above, the Defendant denies the Claimant’s claim in its entirety.

**2\. THE DISPUTE OVER THE "MINIMUM" 500 DAYS** The Defendant denies that it was absolutely obliged to purchase 500 days of consultancy every year regardless of need. 

(a) **The Condition Precedent:** The obligation in Clause 2.1 to purchase 500 days was expressly qualified by the words **"based on project requirement"**. 

(b) **Meaning:** This phrase means the obligation was conditional. If the Defendant’s specific projects did not require 500 days of work, the Defendant was not contractually bound to purchase them. 

(c) **Change in Circumstances:** Following the announcement of the closure of the Government Offices for the Regions (GOR) in 2010, the "project requirement" for the Claimant's services ceased or was significantly reduced. Therefore, the obligation to purchase days also ceased.

**3\. RESPONSE TO PRE-CONTRACTUAL EMAILS** The Claimant relies on an email from Mr. Bentley dated 15 May 2009 to interpret the Contract. The Defendant contends this email is irrelevant because: (a) The critical words **"based on project requirement"** were inserted into the final Contract **after** that email was sent. (b) Consequently, the email reflects an earlier, incomplete stage of negotiation and does not reflect the final agreement.

**4\. THE "FINAL PERIOD" (APRIL – SEPT 2011\)** The Claimant seeks payment for a "pro-rated" minimum of 250 days for the final six months of the contract. This is denied because: (a) **"Per Year" means Per Year:** Clause 2.1 only specifies a minimum "per year". (b) **No Pro-Rating Clause:** Unlike other contracts between these same parties (specifically the *VMware* and *eDesk* agreements), this Contract contains no express term allowing the minimum commitment to be split or pro-rated for a partial year. (c) Therefore, no minimum purchase obligation existed for the final half-year period.

**5\. INCORRECT LEGAL BASIS (DEBT vs. DAMAGES)** The Claimant is suing for a "debt" (money owed for services). The Defendant argues this is legally incorrect. 

(a) **Failure to Request:** If the Defendant failed to buy the 500 days (which is denied), that would be a failure to *request* work. The remedy for that is a claim for **damages** (compensation for loss), not a debt. 

(b) **Duty to Mitigate:** Because it is a claim for damages, the Claimant was required to find other work for its consultants to reduce its losses. The Claimant is put to strict proof that it tried to find other work. 

(c) **Availability:** The Defendant puts the Claimant to strict proof that it actually kept a team of consultants ready and available to work during the entire period of inactivity.

**6\. PENALTY CLAUSE** Alternatively, if the Court finds that Clause 2.1 forces the Defendant to pay for 500 days of work even if no work was needed or done, the Defendant argues this clause is an unenforceable **penalty**. It imposes a punishment out of proportion to the Claimant’s actual loss.

**7\. DISPUTE AS TO VAT** The Claimant has added VAT to its invoices. The Defendant denies VAT is payable on top of the fee. 

(a) **Inclusive Rate:** The agreed fee in Clause 2.3 is "£850 per day". The Contract does not say "£850 *plus VAT*". 

(b) **Supplier's Duty:** Clause 3.7 states the Supplier must comply with VAT legislation. This implies the Supplier must calculate VAT *within* the £850, not add it on top. 

(c) **Legal Precedent:** The Defendant relies on the case of *Lancaster v Bird*, which establishes that if a contract doesn't mention VAT, the price is deemed to include it.

**8\. INTEREST** The Defendant denies it owes statutory interest on late payments. 

(a) **Invalid Invoices:** Under Clause 2.4, payment is due only after a "valid invoice" is received. 

(b) **The Error:** The Claimant’s invoices were invalid because they incorrectly added VAT and claimed for days not worked. 

(c) **Conclusion:** Because the invoices were invalid, the 30-day payment clock never started, and no interest has accrued.

**STATEMENT OF TRUTH**

The Defendant believes that the facts stated in this Defence are true.
